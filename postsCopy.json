Michael Hartman from FrogDice<br/>2. Brian Evans from BTwebgroup.com<br/>3. Aldona Valicenti from LFUCG<br/>4. David Goodnight from Bluegrass Angels<br/><br/>And so, the pitches began!<\/p><p>In order of appearance:<\/p><p>1. <a href=\"http://ezturn.net/\" target=\"_blank\">EZ Turn<\/a> : EZTurn: With the tenacity and disciplined he learned from his time as an NFL player, Chase Minnifield has spent the last years building a growing labor company. He began looking for an app that would assist in the communication and time crunch issues of the “Student Housing Turn” and when he couldn’t find one, he decided to create his own. Minnifield brought along Lincoln Ogata and together, they built EZ Turn: “an easy to use streamlined turn tool that boosts efficiency, saves money, documents turn and provides communication along with transparency from the site to the corporate offices.”<\/p><p><br/>2. <a href=\"https://www.pengeapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Penge<\/a> : Brittany Joiner has a vision - a vision to make personal finance socially acceptable to discuss. As she came out of college and hit the job force, she felt under-prepared, overwhelmed, and struggling to figure out finances on her own. She created spreadsheets and hundereds of Google searches, but she couldn’t find a reliable source that made things easy enough to be practical. Instead, she turned to her friends - and that’s where her vision was born. What if there was a platform you can use to crowdsource information from your community to help you figure out your financial journey, hold you accountable, and encourage you along the way?<\/p><p><br/>3. <a href=\"https://kare.mobi/\" target=\"_blank\">Kare Mobile<\/a> : It’s no secret that going to the dentist is a hassle. Finding one you like, with availability, takes your insurance, doesn’t requires hours taken off work… Kare is here to solve those problems. Kare connects patients to dentists close to them, with availability, and that take their insurance. But beyond that, they’ve built the first mobile-dentists office that will come directly to the comfort of your own home or office to service your dental needs! They offer full-service connection to any dental problems.<\/p><p><br/>4. Vet’s Day Off : Veterinarians are some of the most overworked and overwhelmed practitioners in the US. They notoriously work 7 days a week and suffer from exhaustion and compassion overload have one of the nation’s highest percentages of suicide population &ndash; Vet Data takes these issues seriously and is looking to become the “Airbnb of the vet industry.” They want to utilize the already-standard “relief veterinarian” idea and quickly and easily connect relief vets with vets who desperate need a break. They will help vest provide quality services while also maintaining a healthy work-life balance.<\/p><p><br/>5. <a href=\"https://www.togglehealth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Toggle Health<\/a> : Dubbed “the Roku of the operating room”, Toggle Health is a healthcare technology company with the goal of transforming the operating room. In today’s ORs, if a surgeon needs to adjust their reference photo on their monitor, they have to leave the patient, manually adjust the monitor with the mouse, and leave the room to re-scrub back in. It’s time-consuming, costly, and puts patients at risk. Toggle is combating this broken system by connecting surgeons to their digital case data in the OR using a sterile, wireless controller while our enabling software provides a smart-tv like user experience, allowing surgeons to easily toggle between their desired applications and devices.<\/p><p>Once all 5 companies had presented, the judges left the room to privately decide on the results while the audience members took time to congratulate the contestants on successfully completing their pitches. <br/><\/p><p>Winner of the AwesomeVote app winner (and winner of $50 from Kinetic): Toggle Health!<\/p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9b4fde8558074c12a4d4a0adf0281e71/tumblr_inline_pnyo0xTzQU1spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/><\/figure><p>And most importantly, winner of the February 2019 5 Across was<br/>KARE MOBILE!<\/p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8419cac936b4f3c3d2115c32d5d67df/tumblr_inline_pnyo04vZR91spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/><\/figure><p>The judges cited the company’s bright future in multiple markets - under-served populations, prisons, schools - as their final decision-making factor.<\/p><p style=\"\"><b>Congrats to Kare Mobile - your startup community can’t wait to see you succeed!<br/><br/>See you all in April!<\/b><br/><\/p>"

As the year has come to a close, each winning team of 2017 came back for the ultimate showdown— the 5 Across Finals.  This time around, the noisemakers were louder, the anticipation came to a boil and, with the chance to win $4000, the stakes were higher than ever.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"1067\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a93b71a2b048f20dfedcc58854072203/tumblr_inline_p1bmr3iioh1spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"1067\"/><\/figure><p><b><\/b><\/p><p>Since 2010, Awesome Inc has been home to one of Lexington’s most innovative events. Coined as “the Shark Tank of Lexington,” 5 Across allows startups to pitch their ideas, while networking with like-minded members of the entrepreneurial community. The finals are a definitive statement of the most successful startups in Lexington. The four returning champs were: <a href=\"https://smartstudentstorage.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Student Storage<\/a>, <a href=\"https://www.sum180.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sum180<\/a>, WelcomeHome, Enepret, and <a href=\"https://www.billbusters.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Billbusters<\/a>.<\/p><p>First up was Smart Student Storage, a moving business aimed towards college students. Instead of students juggling final exams and prepping for their end-of-the-semester move, Smart Student Storage will pick up the student’s belongings and place them in a storage unit until the beginning of the next semester.<\/p><p>Second was October’s winner Sum180. The company allows users to set up a financial plan that suits their next big financial decision.  Co-founder and CEO Carla Dearing describes the company with five characteristics:<\/p><p>“1) Meet people where they are in their financial journey; 2) Respect them and understand that they are capable of moving forward if they are provided with simple step-by- step advice; 3) Be unbiased; 4) Not try to give them a finance degree but rather point them toward how-to’s that will help them solve an immediate concern; and 5) Have no ‘guy in the grey suit’ talking down to them.”<\/p><p>Next up was February 5 Across Winner, WelcomeHome. Founded by Kai Zhang, WelcomeHome connects internationals with desirable housing before arriving in the U.S. and helps qualified landlords and rental agencies identify long term reliable international tenants.<\/p><p>“Although our primary customers are internationals, we can also connect domestic customers with desirable housing if they need to move to other places,” said Zhang.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"1067\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e2dc147ad15616ccf8d3c9b7726a833/tumblr_inline_p1bmsgdIM51spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"1067\"/><\/figure><p><b><\/b><\/p><p>August 5 Across winner Chase Kempinski took the stage next and updated the crowd on his company, Enepret.

Co-founder Tyler Menke helped create this company after they realized that him and his colleagues were being overcharged on many of their cable and internet bills. With this, they created BillBusters to give users an easy way to compare cable company prices. Additionally, the team offers to be the middleman in negotiating their customers cable and internet bills.<\/p><p>As the pitches wrapped up, the question remained: Who would be the grand champion of 5 Across 2017? Each company had already proved their worth in the world of startups, but it was up to the judges to decide the ultimate winner.

He received his communications degree from Western Kentucky University and went on to create his own ad agency from 1985 to 1999. Seeking a new challenge, his hard work led him to join Forcht Bank in 2007 as their Chief Marketing and Communications Officer and eventually became a board director in 2014.<br/><\/p><p>The Forcht Group is a conglomerate of companies that includes retail, broadcasting and banking.  Based out of Corbin and Lexington, Kentucky, the multi-million dollar group has brought over 2,000 jobs to south and central Kentucky, all while effectively marketing their message.<\/p><p>Community banking has always been a vital part of any community, helping local businesses thrive, providing great customer service and being more economically sound.  As opposed to bigger banks, community banks have one goal in mind— to help the little guy.  That’s why Forcht Bank is such a staple in Kentucky, but none of that can be done without efficient local advertising. At Awesome Inc, Woodruff will highlight his vital strategies needed for any company seeking successful marketing schemes: product, pricing, sales, message, creative, channel and budget.<\/p><p>A business’ product and channel strategies should be able to establish what the product is, offer a unique selling proposition and seek the best way to advertise that product.  Although there are other forms of channeling your product, such as PR and traditional media, social media has made advertising easier than ever before.   <\/p><p>Regardless of your marketing channel, an effective advertisement should be able to offer a product in 10 words and 30 seconds. No matter what phase your business is at, Woodruff says online advertisements have made this job easier. <\/p><p>“[You’re] better able to target people most likely to purchase than through traditional media,” Woodruff says.<\/p><p>Through sales strategies, you need to establish who your audience is.  In Woodruff’s case, his broad audience would be adults or local business owners in Kentucky.  This ties into your message and creative strategies.<\/p><p>\n\nWith decades of running his own business and being a part of one of Kentucky’s largest companies, Eddie Woodruff is the marketing expert young businesses need to thrive.

      "regular-body": "<p>At 8 a.m., Awesome Inc bootcampers prepare to have a day filled with algorithm warmups, lectures, free time to work on projects, all while fueling themselves with endless amounts of Doublestuf Oreos.  The seemingly fast-paced lectures and projects are jam-packed with rich lessons each student will hold close as they prepare to market themselves to the vast world of software development.  This bootcamp is not simply a course that gives brief, vague lessons in coding, it is a course that will pave the future of participants, whose career backgrounds might come as a surprise to most.<b><br/><\/b><\/p><p>\tJosh Stewart was a college lacrosse coach and received an M.A. in Higher Education at Messiah College in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.  College athletics caused him to move frequently and he realized that in order to support his family better, he needed to shift careers.  At 28, he decided to check out Awesome Inc’s Web Developer Bootcamp.<\/p><p>\t“How can I have a better work/life balance, how can I make more money, and how can I stay put? I solved all three of those problems at once,” said Stewart.<\/p><p>Typically, Stewart is quick to picking new things up, so it came as a surprise to realize that coding language would be more challenging than he anticipated.  But with hard work and the right attitude, his finished projects made it all worth it.  He is now equipped with the knowledge that is guaranteed to guide him into his new career path.  It’s the last week of classes and he has already had three job interviews.  Simply put and in his own words, Awesome Inc has surpassed his expectations.<\/p><p>Brandon Spencer spent over a decade in restaurant management. With some high school coding experience and a B.A. in History under his belt, his interest in web development came at the forefront after learning of Awesome Inc’s bootcamp one year ago.  His itch for wanting to learn more led him to the three month course that has been met with a rewarding and life-enhancing experience.<\/p><p>“It’s surprising to see how far you’ve come, but also an understanding that there are a lot of things you still don’t know,” said Spencer.  “We’re pretty well-equipped to be able to figure it out, which I think was one of the goals from day one.”<\/p><p>For future bootcampers, Spencer has a few vital pieces of advice: get some sleep, remember that everyone feels defeated at times, and no matter what “keep pushing forward.”<\/p><p>The three month course has been an uphill battle for some bootcampers, but despite the frustration that comes with any new task, the payoff is well worth it.<\/p><p>“12 weeks ago, I couldn’t write a line of code,” Stewart said. “It seems like we have all the tools and support system from Awesome Inc to get a job.”<\/p><p>Education and career backgrounds are not a determining factor in who can become the future of software development.  What does determine it?  Hard work, dedication, persistence and the strive to grow as an individual.<\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p>What happens when you get 40+ successful entrepreneurs in the same cabin for a weekend? Ego clashes? Best practices? Inspiring stories?<br/><\/p><p>With each individual holding conflicting expectations of the Fellowship summer retreat, Awesome Inc co-founder, Brian Raney, and Fellowship Director, Keith McMunn, led the first session to establish a culture for the retreat.  Core values have preserved the unique and open culture at Awesome Inc throughout the years, so entrepreneurs teamed up with investors and friends of the Fellowship to pitch values that they believed would provide a unique and open culture for the retreat. The group agreed on several values that created a space for vulnerability, empathy, inclusiveness, and getting out of your comfort zone. <\/p><p>The next session was led by management expert and Fellowship mentor Drew Sutton, who gave a very informative presentation about the characteristics and challenges faced by great leaders. Drew’s presentation was filled with historical and comic book references that kept everyone laughing, while extremely engaged. He mentioned that a good leader must keep his team prepared for the “fog of war,” explaining that it’s his job as a leader to inform his employees of the guiding principles that will help them make decisions on behalf of the company in the fog. Drew shared that he keeps all the principles and values that he expects from his employees written down and presents them to every new hire. <\/p><p>After bonding through both sessions, Brian Raney regained the room’s attention and laid down the rules for a game that was played throughout the next two days. The game, affectionately called “murder,” was started with Brian secretly selecting three murderers among the group. The three assassins were tasked to ‘kill’ the townspeople, and the group would vote on who they thought was committing each crime. <\/p><p>The “smoothest-kill-of-the-weekend” was made by Ford from Cloverleaf.  Ford scaled the side of the cabin, jumped onto the balcony, took out everyone in the hot tub, and walked inside before anyone noticed. The only witness to the crime was the cabin groundskeeper, who saw Ford dramatically leap from the balcony during his escape.  Unfortunately, he was unable to provide any incriminating evidence.  Other murders were not as smooth and resulted in mass shootouts, and hitmen getting caught after single shots. <\/p><p>In addition to the fun icebreakers, attendees bonded while tubing down the Little River in Gatlinburg and hiking to a beautiful waterfall during a summer rain shower. Cloverleaf held the last session of the first day. The founders had collected data from attendees including their Myers Briggs, DiSC, and workplace culture preferences and used the results of the data to pair harmonious groups.  After discussing their effectiveness as a team, they had to put it into practice by completing the egg drop challenge with just post-its, straws, and plastic cutlery. Each team dropped their egg without it breaking, which may be evidence of Cloverleaf’s software successfully brings effective teams together. <\/p><p>The next day, sessions leaned on the technical side with a representative from Dinsmore &amp; Shohl, LLP sharing how to get the best service from a law firm. The group learned that entrepreneurs often seek help from an attorney too late into the process, so it is best to begin the relationship with a practice while building your company. This allows you to obtain more negotiable price points and to connect with the right type of firm for your business. <\/p><p>Following the Dinsmore session, Elizabeth Rounsavall, a Venture Capitalist, shared a wealth of information about investment opportunities for startups. Founders in the room opened up by sharing their experiences with boards and investors. As they discussed best practices, Elizabeth gave them the Venture Capitalist’s point of view on what a Kentucky investor expects compared to what an out of state investor will take an interest in.<\/p><p>The final session was led by friends of Awesome Inc, Bryce and <a href=\"https://www.emergedevelopmentcenter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Elzaba Anderson<\/a>. They shared their stories of trials in entrepreneurship, inspiring the group to think about their “why” and “good.” Bryce spoke about his journey with Vinaigrette Salad Kitchen and the failures he faced while trying to carry out his “why” of working with Kentucky farmers.  Bryce’s story moved the group to think about the principles and values that keep them afloat while trying to fulfill their own “why.” <\/p><p>Elzaba encouraged everyone to breakup and discuss how to find value and approval for their sense of good. The circle was asked to reflect on their lifestyle, which segued perfectly into a moving speech, aka “The Thing,” from Brian Raney at the close of the retreat. Brian spoke about his “why” when he created Awesome Inc and his own moments of doubt and the thing that reminded him to carry on with his vision. <\/p><p>The summer retreat was filled with great opportunities for learning, networking and reflecting. In typical Awesome Inc fashion, we made time for fun and games of murder in between. The greatest takeaway are the bonds that were established between motivated startups.  All the while, the value of surrounding yourself with people who are passionate about your work is priceless.<\/p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DsrgwnwDVV3Y%26t%3D2s\"><iframe id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/srgwnwDVV3Y?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&amp;wmode=opaque\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"304\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/figure>",

      "regular-title": "Bill Burke: Revolutionizing the Energy Industry With Real Time Data",
      "regular-body": "<p>Bill knew from a young age that he wanted to be an engineer but after graduating with a mechanical engineering degree from UK and working for Lexmark, he wasn&rsquo;t so sure if a corporate setting was for him. Bill moved to California in 2003 to work for a startup, while his wife went to school at Berkeley. He began to fall in love with the startup community there but after ten months at his new startup job, the company was sold and he, too, applied to and was accepted to a Berkeley Phd program.<br/><\/p><p>During his time in school, he worked with the Berkeley Energy Commission and continued immersing himself in the energy industry. After graduation he joined the GE energy management team. His work involved connecting appliances to the internet to collect data which would later inspire his own startup. <\/p><p>After ten years of working in the energy industry, Bill came to the same realization that made him leave Lexington for California in the first place. He didn’t like working for other people. “I hated working at GE. The work was great. The people were great. The problem was me.” Bill decided to give the startup world another go by creating his own company. After a first attempt at a SaaS platform called Lingua, anattempt to recreate the engineering software MatLab in the cloud, Bill decided to resort back to his roots in energy when he started Virtual Peaker. <\/p><blockquote><p><b> “I hated working at GE. The work was great. The people were great. The problem was me.”<\/b><\/p><\/blockquote><p>Virtual Peaker is a SaaS that connects home owners to the logistics of their home systems (like their hot water heaters) and recommends settings that would save them money. The information can also help the energy companies have a more predictable supply. The problem with the current model of the energy business is that energy is generated as needed, and demand can be unpredictable.. If companies are able to grasp in real time what the needs of the people are, then it&rsquo;s much easier to generate energy proactively versus the reactive system that’s in place now. Virtual Peaker providers a platform creating a win-win scenario for both users and providers. <\/p><p>Bill has seen a lot of growth with his platform but still states the difficulties of being an entrepreneur with a family. He says, “It’s really scary being a startup founder with kids. Spending time with my family makes me a better person and clears my mind.” He asserts that his family is what drives him to work hard and enables him to do what he loves. He gives a lot of praise to his wife by saying, “I can’t possibly do this without my wife. She’s supported me all along the way. Without her, I couldn’t be here doing this.” <\/p><p>He looks to young entrepreneurs saying he wishes there was an impactful one-liner that he could give them as though starting a business had a simple code to success, but it&rsquo;s a long process that he explains can be lonely and really hard. You’ll absolutely want to quit, he states, “That’s why there are lots of wantrepreneurs and not many entrepreneurs.” He think it’s important to remember that even overnight successes have about 5 years of work that went in on the back end.<\/p><blockquote><p><b>“That’s why there are lots of wantrepreneurs and not many entrepreneurs.”<\/b><\/p><\/blockquote><p>Bill lives in Louisville, KY with his wife Krista and 3 kids, Molly, Penelope and Sydney. He spends most of his free time with his family. Bill runs trails an impressive 6 days a week in order to get time to himself. <\/p><p>Learn more about how Virtual Peaker is increasing the IQ of the power grid by clicking <a href=\"http://www.virtualpeaker.io/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<br/><\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><i>They all contribute to the story of the founders of Pasiv Duty.<\/i><br/><\/p><p>by Vidyaarthi Pugalenthi<\/p><p>Blake Caudill began in Landscaping. He worked with his father and brother in the 8th grade and eventually it helped him buy his first truck and pay for college where he was pre-med. Half way through undergrad, Blake began to rethink his decision to pursue medicine. He thought back to owning the landscaping company with his father and brother and wanted to grow in his ability to lead more companies of his own in the future . Blake switched his major to business and found a complementary passion in technology. Out of college, he began his first project called NetReset. His idea was to solve the issues people have with their internet connection and having to reset their router every now and then. <a href=\"http://www.netreset.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NetReset<\/a> works with your router to reset it every night to improve overall internet connection. Blake now sells 4,000 units a month on Amazon, Sam’s Club, etc.<\/p><p>Blake and his business partner Jeremy Patches met when they were working IT in the coal industry, developing a product called the Fog Pod that aimed to create a safer system for coal miner. While developing their first tech products for the coal industry, Blake recalls watching news reports about the tension building between civilians and law enforcement. Blake transitioned the technology he was initially developing for coal miners into a system that tracks and notifies the police department when a fire arm is pulled from the holster of one of its officers. <\/p><p>Why exactly would this be the moment that is reported back to the station? It creates accountability. Blake spoke with the head of the Lexington police department who told him, “All I really care about is when that firearm is pulled. That’s when backup needs to be sent and someone needs to be held accountable if an incident were to occur.” <\/p><p>They officially named the product, <a href=\"http://www.pasivduty.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pasiv Duty<\/a>. It would notify the Police department when a firearm is pulled and send the location of the officer so that backup can come to the scene.<\/p><blockquote><p><b>“All I really care about is when that firearm is pulled,” - Lexington Police Department<\/b><\/p><\/blockquote><p>That was Blake’s “aha” moment. Now the product is being tested in several police departments in multiple Kentucky counties today. Blake has seen success with many of his products in his career, so we decided to ask him what he would like to say to young entrepreneurs. <\/p><p>“The key is that you have to build value for the customer first, then for your employees and your team, and then for society. You should always take the time to understand your criticism because your product is never perfect and you should do your best to spot where it can be improved.” He also goes on to explain that the product will never be perfect. There has to be a point where you just carry on because you can afford to wait until it’s perfect. <\/p><blockquote><p><b>“The product will never be perfect. There has to be a point where you just carry on because you can afford to wait until it’s perfect.”<\/b><\/p><\/blockquote><p>In Blake’s free time he enjoys researching the newest trends in technology. His favorite podcasts include RadioLab and Freakonomics. He lives with his wife Elizabeth and two dogs, Cali and Nappa.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><i>The entrepreneurial journey of startup founder Darrin Murriner<\/i><br/><\/p><p>by Vidyaarthi Pugalenthi<\/p><p>Darrin Murriner, UK Alumni and Berea Kentucky Native, began his entrepreneurial success when he was told by his father that he wasn’t getting a Nintendo. Starting his track record of excellence, Darrin struck a deal with his father offering to pay for half of the gaming system himself. His father worked for a specialty advertising business and Darrin took his father’s sample pens and pencils and sold them to his middle school classmates. Darrin collected fifty dollars by the end of the week and quickly fell in love with the feeling of earning his money. <\/p><p>His humble and funny nature has drawn others to propose their business ideas to him ever since he was in college. Typically, he welcomes new business ideas with a sense of skepticism, looking for the potential opportunities in all the problems around him. Several years ago, Darrin’s co-founder, Ford, brought him the idea for a repository of personality assessments. Darrin at the time was working with another start-up but the idea showed a lot of potential for improvement. The potential to leverage the results from an individual’s assessments to improve teams in multiple industries eventually convinced Darrin to leave and join in the creation of Cloverleaf. <a href=\"http://cloverleaf.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Cloverleaf<\/a> is Saas that collects different assessments of an individual’s skillsets and personality allows for better team building in the workplace.<\/p><p>Before Cloverleaf, Darrin began a project with his wife Peggy when she wanted to transition out of her corporate job. After reading Jim Collin’s book Good to Great, she started with the question “What can you do better than anybody else?” Peggy had previous worked in a child care agency and seen an opportunity to automate the tedious scheduling that she had previously done by hand. Darrin and Peggy began their first software company to solve this problem called <a href=\"https://www.babysitease.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BabySit Ease<\/a>. Today they are considering the sale of the spin off company that Peggy manages. <\/p><p>The ability to create an opportunity with what you&rsquo;re good at, demonstrated by Peggy’s success with Pair Up, is one of the skills that Darrin believes creates a successful entrepreneur. Darrin explains that drive, ability to adapt, and demonstrating a value to your audience are what set great founders apart. <\/p><p>Darrin advises young entrepreneurs to begin with your community and find a team that has different skillsets from your own.<\/p><blockquote><p><b>“It takes a team. You can’t do it on your own. I think we glorify individuals in the startup community, but generally there is a team behind it. Build a solid team.”<\/b><\/p><\/blockquote><p>Darrin is currently focused on Cloverleaf and increasing value for all of its users. He wants the software to provide a better way to look at a team, put the right people in the right places and help individuals better understand their objectives.<\/p><p><br/>When asked what problem he is going solve next, he laughed explaining that he’s been trying to control the natural impulse to find new opportunities so that he can stay single mindedly focussed on Cloverleaf. The idea proposals haven’t stopped though, “When you’re labeled as an entrepreneur people come to you with ideas.”<\/p><p>Today Darrin lives in Newport, KY with his wife, son and twin daughters. In his free time, his kids take him to the pool in exchange for taking the kids on hiking trips. “The kids are cool with hiking as long as there are things to climb on,” he jokes. He’s nervous to find out how the kids will react when he reveals his plans to take his kids on his visit to Glacier National Park in August.  <\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p>by Keith McMunn<\/p><p><b>3 Quick Lessons for Startup Founders from Scott Weiss’ Corporate Career<\/b><br/><\/p><p>He looked about as comfortable in front of a crowd of people as you might expect a CEO to look. In his blue jeans and button down shirt, Scott Weiss adjusted his microphone as he prepared to tell a room of young entrepreneurs about the journey of his corporate career and how it helps him as the CEO of Ocean Accelerator, a nationally-recognized program designed to help startups grow.<\/p><p>“After graduating from Indiana University and getting a Masters at the University of Michigan, I worked for a little company called Procter and Gamble for many years,” Weiss told the room.<\/p><p><b>Have the humility to listen and the boldness to learn.<\/b><\/p><p>The reason Weiss started working at P&amp;G? Well, it all goes back to one evening in the early days of his marriage. He and his wife were struggling for direction in their careers and to find the money to pay rent. This particular evening she found an envelope that he had thrown in the garbage. The return address was from Procter and Gamble, a company neither of them were familiar with. After opening the envelope, Weiss’ wife found that he was being offered a Marketing internship, an industry he had no prior experience with. The offer was left-field enough to prompt him to throw it back in the garbage.<\/p><p>With some strong encouragement from his wife, Weiss stepped into the internship opportunity at P&amp;G. The internship would lead to a full-time offer and eventually many successful years of working alongside major brands like Tide and Brita.<\/p><p><b>Show what better looks like.<\/b><\/p><p>“Brita is an amazing story,” Weiss told us.<\/p><p>Weiss and his team celebrated tremendous success from the introduction of Brita’s personal water-filtration system. The celebration was short-lived, however. They noticed that first-time Brita users came in droves but didn’t seem to return. In other words, many people were excited to try the product but unconvinced to purchase replacement filters for future use.<\/p><p>“I searched everywhere for the problem. I spent months traveling and interviewing people asking why they didn’t feel compelled to continue filtering their water after their initial experiences with the product.”<\/p><p>The resounding answer became, “Scott, the water goes in clear and comes out clear. How the heck am I supposed to believe it’s working?”<\/p><p>“That was it,” he thought. “Even if it’s nasty to look at, customers want to see the product working.”<\/p><p><b>Realize your relationships.<\/b><\/p><p>Fortunately, Weiss remembered building a relationship with a Japanese company that specialized in non-fibrous kidney dialysis filters earlier in his career.<\/p><p>Though years had passed and the connection seemed like a stretch, Weiss was able to approach them, and the result was the implementation of something similar to their design on the Brita. This allowed water-drinkers to see a collection of dirt and deposits at the top of their Brita while water continued through the filtration process. With the new feature, first-time Brita buyers started returning enthusiastically, and sales regained their strength.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>BY TYLER HAKES<br/><\/p><p>About two years ago, I was tapped for an amazing opportunity.<\/p><p>My friends at <a href=\"http://collegeraptor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">College Raptor<\/a> had just raised a Series A round for their incredible college matching technology. And the CEO asked me to help them figure out how to make it scale.<\/p><p>It was a consumer platform, offered for free, with the main objective being to scale traffic and drive user growth.<\/p><p>I was pumped.<\/p><p>I was ready.<\/p><p>Actually, I was <i>terrified<\/i>.<\/p><p>I had never done this before.<\/p><p>I had worked in marketing for my entire career and helped a lot of different companies grow their traffic and sales. But I never had to start at 0 and figure out how to get to a million.<\/p><p>The climb seemed daunting.<\/p><p>I knew that content marketing was super effective at growing and scaling a website’s traffic. I’d done that in the past and I knew it worked–somehow.<\/p><p>But, like a lot of people, my approach to content marketing up to this point was basically just to “blog and pray.” I knew that creating content could drive a lot of high-value traffic and generate leads and sales, but I didn’t really know how to track, measure, or control that growth in any meaningful way.<\/p><p>With such a big target, I had to figure out what was working for everyone else and put together a plan that we could measure and rely upon.<\/p><p>“Blog and pray” wasn’t going to be a good approach when I had to talk to the board of directors and investors.<\/p><p>We needed a plan and we needed results.<\/p><p>So, I started reading–a lot.<\/p><p>I found so many incredible resources on the web that taught me everything from how to do really in-depth keyword research to how to use competitive analysis to get to great content more quickly.<\/p><p>I was introduced to the Skyscraper Technique and learned about the absolute necessity of manual outreach and link building.<\/p><p>Together, these articles became my base of knowledge which I used to form the strategy that we would go on to use at College Raptor.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"901\" data-orig-height=\"273\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9373f8851caf78e424f39089855dc987/tumblr_inline_onhq5zCqaU1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"901\" data-orig-height=\"273\"/><\/figure><p>And that strategy turned out to be incredibly effective.<\/p><p>Just over one year after launching, we had generated well over a million visitors to the website and were bringing in over 100,000 organic sessions per month.

And it became the basis for much of our strategy moving forward.<\/p><p>Here it is: <b>Each piece of content doesn’t have to meet all 3 objectives<\/b>.<\/p><p>Obvious, right?<\/p><p>It seems like it now.<\/p><p>But at the time, I was so focused on figuring out how to check all the boxes that it didn’t immediately dawn on me that each piece of content we produced could meet just one objective and that together they would generate the same outcome.<\/p><p>I think a lot of companies get stuck right on this point.<\/p><p>They understand the intrinsic roles of content, but when it comes time to actually creating it and coming up with topics, they get stuck because they can’t think of any topics that serve every single purpose.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"663\" data-orig-height=\"219\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6bb1525bca56af5785634a26f75ab7dd/tumblr_inline_onhq8ju42x1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"663\" data-orig-height=\"219\"/><\/figure><p>The answer is: You probably don’t!<br/><\/p><p>And this realization became the basis for our strategy.<\/p><p>Sure, sometimes you nail all of these objectives. Every once in awhile, you land on the perfect piece of content that feels like it fires on all cylinders. But most of the long-term growth and planning shouldn’t be spent wracking your brain for this single, golden unicorn.<\/p><p>Instead, break it down.<\/p><p>Rather than expecting every piece of content to accomplish everything, create three separate pieces of content, each one serving a purpose within the bigger strategy.<\/p><p>So that’s what we did.<\/p><h2>The Trifecta: Our Content Marketing Strategy<\/h2><p>Here’s how our content marketing strategy was structured:<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"7075\" data-orig-height=\"3333\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/909d52920877706a257cafa29ae99cee/tumblr_inline_onhq96kmcH1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"7075\" data-orig-height=\"3333\"/><\/figure><p>I call this our “Trifecta Strategy” because it has three basic components.<\/p><p>Here’s how we broke down each piece:<\/p><p><b>1. Evergreen content<\/b><\/p><p>This content was built for search. It was topical and keyword-focused.<\/p><p>Think of it like the meat and potatoes of the site. It answered questions like, “what’s a good ACT score?,” or, “what do colleges look for from students who apply?”<\/p><p>We knew that the people searching for these topics were our target market. We wanted them to find the answer with us so that we could then encourage them to check out the product we had to offer.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"1079\" data-orig-height=\"662\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f10a6f079f47992c17ea2da775c248df/tumblr_inline_onhq9ipymz1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1079\" data-orig-height=\"662\"/><\/figure><p>But this stuff wasn’t super sexy.<\/p><p>Not every post is bound for viral greatness or worthy of a million backlinks. <i>And that’s okay<\/i>.<\/p><p>In many cases, we barely even promoted this content–if at all. We let Google do all the heavy lifting and generate traffic over time.<\/p><p>By building out a huge library of this kind of topical, focused, evergreen content, we were able to cast a wide net–bringing in students and parents who were at different stages in the college search and admissions process.<\/p><p><b>2. Social-viral content<\/b><\/p><p>This content was designed specifically to play well within our target demographic market on social media. It was created to generate likes, shares, and traffic.<\/p><p>It didn’t have to be super informative. It didn’t have to be keyword optimized or meaty enough to get links.<\/p><p>Think like Buzzfeed.<\/p><p>“13 Owl Photos that Look Like Celebrities,” probably doesn’t get a lot of search traffic or earn a bunch of links.<\/p><p>But it goes gangbusters on Facebook.<\/p><p>And that drives a ton of traffic and creates brand awareness.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"1079\" data-orig-height=\"652\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bec9e6aa160cde325a2457863450fe55/tumblr_inline_onhqa0py0Z1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1079\" data-orig-height=\"652\"/><\/figure><p>Using elements of surprise, fun, or intrigue make content go viral–but that’s an entire post unto itself.<\/p><p>We used social-viral content as a way to get our target market familiar with our site, to build awareness, and to start to earn trust.<\/p><p>You might also use this kind of content in a more traditional funnel to start to qualify prospects. You could use social-viral content to generate traffic and then use retargeting or other tactics to convert those visitors into leads.<\/p><p><b>3. Link-building content<\/b><\/p><p>Last, but certainly not least, we needed links to our site in order to put the evergreen content to work. Without strong domain authority, all of those articles were just lost out in the sea of Google results, probably somewhere around page 20.<\/p><p>By creating separate content assets that were specifically aimed at earning links, we were able to “raise the ship,” providing authority to our entire domain and raising the Google ranking of all of our pages.<\/p><p>This kind of content requires you to often times take off your marketing hat for a minute.<\/p><p>Forget about your target audience.<\/p><p>Instead, think about other sites, writers, or publishers.<\/p><p>What kind of content do they link to?<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"654\" data-orig-height=\"688\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b67776d193ec1077422ca799465cd74/tumblr_inline_onhqamy5kD1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"654\" data-orig-height=\"688\"/><\/figure><p>If you study this, you’ll realize that the kind of content that earns links from reputable websites is often not your run-of-the-mill blog post. It’s an engaging graphic, a new study, or an especially valuable resource.<\/p><p>But it’s also not as easy as simply publishing great content and waiting around for links. You need to do promotion and outreach to get the content in front of the right people. And that’s what we did.<\/p><p>For every piece of link-building content that we created, we spent about twice as much time doing research, compiling contacts, and doing email outreach.<\/p><p>Now you may be thinking that this Trifecta Strategy means you’ll have to create three times as much content. But that’s not really true. You don’t need 1,000 articles to generate 1,000 links–you only need one great resource with the right promotional strategy.<\/p><p>This is why the Trifecta Strategy is so effective.<\/p><p>It’s about creating a strategic mix of content, with each piece serving a purpose. It’s about making every piece of content work as hard as possible.<\/p><p>In our case, we did end up producing a lot of content in order to achieve the end result–because our addressable market was huge and there are a lot of different topics to cover. But in a smaller market, this strategy may only mean having a few really strong, product-focused landing pages that are propped up by content that’s used to earn links.<\/p><p>Either way, the main point remains true: Your content should work together to achieve the stated objectives. Each piece should have a purpose.<\/p><p>But each piece doesn’t have to serve every purpose.<\/p><p>Note: If this were a B2B company or you wanted to generate leads or email subs, we would also add content assets that are designed to generate leads like white papers, ebooks, email courses, etc. That would make it a “Quadfecta,” I suppose.<\/p><h2><b>Using Public Data to Score Early Wins<\/b><\/h2><p>One of the recurring things we noticed when studying different kinds of content was that most of the companies that really crushed it at building links were using data to do so.<\/p><p>Interesting studies, analysis, or maps–they’re everywhere. We all love a nice graphic or a data visualization. And unexpected facts and figures make for sexy headlines.<\/p><p>So, we set out to try to capture a piece of that success for ourselves.<\/p><p>One of our early successes was so simple, it seems crazy in retrospect.<\/p><p>We spent a few days coming up with ideas and putting together a piece of content–a nice infographic, backed by some data. Then we put together an outreach plan where we targeted news media and bloggers who we thought would be interested in what we had found.<\/p><p>We hit publish and sent out some basic outreach emails sharing the content with the writers we identified.<\/p><p>And we waited.<\/p><p>Was this going to work?<\/p><p>It was really our first attempt to grab some big attention and build links. We weren’t sure what the expect.<\/p><p>But just a few minutes after we sent out our emails, we got a big break.<\/p><p>I got this email:<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"457\" data-orig-height=\"183\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9bc12d1f26e408ee9be322623742b0e/tumblr_inline_onhqb0J1a71spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"457\" data-orig-height=\"183\"/><\/figure><p>Holy shit.<\/p><p>We got picked up by the Washington Post.<\/p><p>But from there, things really took off.<\/p><p>Once the post went up on WaPo, our content got picked up by dozens of outlets.<\/p><p>The Houston Chronicle in Texas. The Deseret News in Utah. Minnesota Public Radio. Time magazine. We found out later that the content was even cited before the U.S. Supreme Court.<\/p><p>So what was this groundbreaking piece of content?<\/p><p>What compelled all of these news outlets to take heed and post us on their website?<\/p><p>It was a map of the United States. With some college logos. And a bit of analysis.<\/p><p>Seriously, here’s the post: <a href=\"https://www.collegeraptor.com/blog/college-trends/senate-u-2015-where-the-114th-u-s-senate-went-to-college/\" target=\"_blank\">Where the 114th U.S. Senate Went to College<\/a>.<\/p><p>We literally looked up the list of U.S. senators on Wikipedia and researched each one to figure out where they went to school. Then we made it into a map and did some basic analysis.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"679\" data-orig-height=\"670\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fb8f79ae939745ab9a9f713e7ba098c8/tumblr_inline_onhqbqwkmD1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"679\" data-orig-height=\"670\"/><\/figure><p>Trust me, it was <i>not <\/i>rocket science.<\/p><p>The biggest lesson to take away from our victory here is that you can totally use publicly available data to make cool content.<\/p><p><b>You don’t need to fund some expensive research study if you use the data that’s already out there.<\/b> And there’s a <i>ton <\/i>of it.<\/p><p>We used other public data sources time and time again throughout the year to create rankings, infographics, maps, and other content and resources.<\/p><p>You can find data from a number of sources, but here are some ideas of where to look:<\/p><ul><li>Public/government databases (we used IPEDS data extensively)<\/li><li>Manual research (like our data on the senators)<\/li><li>Google trends/keyword data (regional interests, trends over time, etc)<\/li><li>Published research and reports from academic journals<\/li><li>Trade publications and industry studies<\/li><li>Facebook advertising/page data<\/li><\/ul><p>All of this data is out there–and it’s free.<\/p><p>The key to using it is to find new and interesting ways to approach the data. Take something that exists in the world and make it better, sexier, or easier to understand.<\/p><p>You can use this data to create things like:<\/p><ul><li>Static infographics or data visualizations<\/li><li>Interactive data tools or resources<\/li><li>Maps, charts, and graphs<\/li><li>Ratings or rankings<\/li><li>Layered research based on data from multiple sources<\/li><\/ul><p>Once you have something cool and interesting, then it’s just a matter of showing it to the right people. Email it to writers who cover the beat. Make it simple for them to pull it down and use it in their own stories.<\/p><p><b>Keep in mind that this content doesn’t necessarily have to be created for your primary audience.<\/b> It should be related to your market, for sure. But the real goal here is to get links.<\/p><p>Writers and publishers in your industry are your target audience, not your average user.<\/p><p>Our infographic wasn’t really going to appeal to a 16-18-year-old high school kid. It didn’t really help them find the right college. But it helped us get links, which helped us bring traffic to all of our content that <i>was <\/i>aimed at our main audience.<\/p><p>Remember, the strategy is about putting together the pieces, not trying to make every piece of content meet all of your goals at once.<\/p><h2><b>Our First Viral Success &amp; What We Learned<\/b><\/h2><p>Early on, we saw a lot of wins like the infographic from above. Little victories here, spikes in traffic there.<\/p><p>But nothing compared to our first big success.<\/p><p>In the last week of May, we published something new and different. At the time, we honestly weren’t sure how it would go.<\/p><p>We knew that we wanted to go after the world of college rankings, which are big game for many major publishers. But we couldn’t compete head-to-head on a list of “Best Colleges.” We didn’t have the authority to get traction there (yet).<\/p><p>So, we improvised. We put our own spin on things.<\/p><p>And we came up with the idea to create a ranking of “Hidden Gems.” These were colleges that, according to our methodology, were being overlooked by students when compared to other colleges of similar quality.<\/p><p>For the sake of simplicity, let me just say that this was a different kind of college ranking.<\/p><p>One of the things that we got right (in retrospect) was that many of the colleges we honored were not your typical “Best Of” colleges. They were still good schools, but they generally weren’t on a list of the top 100.<\/p><p>Fast forward to the day of the launch.<\/p><p>After spending a few days compiling all of the data, creating some graphics, and putting together the final post, we clicked publish.  Then we got to work on outreach.<\/p><p>We had a plan to promote the content and put in front of people who mattered most. We sent out hundreds of emails and messages to colleges, newspapers, counselors, and anyone else we could think of who might help us spread the word about the ranking.<\/p><p>I spent the better part of the day drafting and sending emails.<\/p><p>Then we started to see results.<\/p><p>We watched as traffic started to pour into the site. 10 people. 20 people. 100 people. Pretty soon we had a steady stream–hundreds of people on the site at once for hours on end.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"757\" data-orig-height=\"214\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9bd80e7286d8a31b93050d60959ca048/tumblr_inline_onhqd5Yer81spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"757\" data-orig-height=\"214\"/><\/figure><p>The colleges on our list were sharing the content on their social channels and their students and alumni were sharing it from there.<\/p><p>We were going viral.<\/p><p>When the dust had settled, we had the biggest spike in traffic to date.<\/p><p><b>250,000 visitors in just one week.<\/b> That’s huge.<\/p><p>We also generated a ton of links–many from reputable news websites and EDU domains.<\/p><p>From this success, we learned a lot about what factors would help push our content over the top:<\/p><p><b>1. People love sharing maps<\/b><\/p><p>As you may be able to tell from our first big successes, people really, really love maps. Seriously, they do. And we figured out early that we could use them effectively. I think it plays on both our sense of identity and our sense of being different from other people in the country.<\/p><p>We would go on to use this as a cornerstone of our link-building strategy, segmenting data geographically whenever possible.<\/p><p><b>2. Vested interest helps expand reach<\/b><\/p><p>We were posting about colleges and shining a spotlight on their institutions. So, by including these colleges in the actual content, they had a vested interest in promoting the piece.<\/p><p>In total, we had a college from every state–or a base of 50 targets for outreach.<\/p><p>To boot, since we took a different approach in our rankings, many of the colleges on the list were not used to receiving national accolades. These weren’t the same 50 schools that are on the U.S. News list of top colleges every single year. But they were still good institutions.<\/p><p>This taught us the power of vested interest. Any time our content could help promote another entity, we could work with them to expand our reach and grow our audience.<\/p><p><b>3. Self-affirmation and positive social proof encourage sharing<\/b><\/p><p>The effect was amplified even further because each of these colleges had an audience of alumni and current students. All of them had their own vested interest in the positive social proof of having attended a “Hidden Gem” college. So many of them shared it and helped spread it far and wide.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"839\" data-orig-height=\"648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/451e36a21ca761735df0952c74029abe/tumblr_inline_onhqducQpl1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"839\" data-orig-height=\"648\"/><\/figure><p>Our content ended up with tens of thousands of shares, likes, and comments. (Note: The numbers here don’t seem to be displaying likes/comments correctly, but the share count lines up with what we saw a few months after publishing the post.)<\/p><p>We learned that one of the keys to going viral is to create content that plays on our desire for self-affirmation. People love to share things from reputable, third-party sources that seem to confirm a belief they already have (e.g., they made a great choice by attending the college they chose.)<\/p><p><b>4. Coordinated outreach is critical<\/b><\/p><p>Outreach is ultimately what made this piece work.<\/p><p>We gathered hundreds of contacts. We wanted to make sure that someone saw it at each college. We wanted to send it to their respective local media. And we wanted other influencers to take note of a new type of college ranking that didn’t have the same 20 schools at the top.<\/p><p>Our team spent way more time doing outreach and follow-up to ensure the success of this piece than we did actually creating it.<\/p><p>That proved to be a big lesson for us moving forward.<\/p><p><b>Great content is great, but it ultimately doesn’t matter if noone sees it<\/b>.<\/p><p>Although we had already focused on outreach, this caused us to realize the magnitude of the outreach we needed to do to achieve these kind of results.<\/p><p><b>5. Comprehensive promotional materials make it easy for people to help you<\/b><\/p><p>If you want people to promote your content, you need to give them everything they need to do it.<\/p><p>Make it so simple they can’t say no.<\/p><p>When we did outreach to colleges about this recognition, we didn’t just send them a link to our post.<\/p><p>Oh, no. We did way more than that.<\/p><p>We prepared a press release template. We created a visual badge. We gave them specific materials and instructions on how to promote and publicize the achievement.<\/p><p>And it worked.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"714\" data-orig-height=\"271\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be9f724915bbf9e11877fbb27615279a/tumblr_inline_onhqelRJNy1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"714\" data-orig-height=\"271\"/><\/figure><p>Dozens of colleges used the materials we put together and helped promote this piece, sending it viral, and generating tons of links back to our site–almost all of them from high-authority EDU domains.<\/p><h2>Rinse &amp; Repeat<\/h2><p>Okay, so we had some big wins under our belt. I mean, we had just driven a quarter of a million people to our website in 7 days.<\/p><p>We made it. Right?<\/p><p>Well, not exactly. In fact, that was dead wrong.<\/p><p>We learned quickly that although we celebrated every win as a huge victory, the traffic quickly died down. Just as quickly as the Internet shines its light on you, it moves on to the next thing.<\/p><p>And that’s another big lesson to learn. Sustained growth for a website like this doesn’t come through a single flash of brilliance or a viral success. It almost never works that way.<\/p><p>It’s incremental. It’s slow–sometimes painfully so.<\/p><p>Keep in mind that what you’re doing is basically trying to assemble an airplane in mid-flight. You’re trying to create content that will rank well in search, while at the same time also earning the links that you need for that content to rank.<\/p><p>It’s not an overnight process.<\/p><p>And you will fail at times. You’ll spend too much time creating something you think is great, only to have it fall flat when it’s finally pushed out into the world. That’s okay.<\/p><p>The key is consistency and process.<\/p><p>Keep moving forward.<\/p><h2><b>Hitting Explosive Growth<\/b><\/h2><p>At this point, we were on a solid growth path. We were seeing steady increases in traffic and all of our existing content was rising in the SERPs.<\/p><p>We were about 8 months in and had about 150-200 linking domains.<\/p><p>But we didn’t set out to achieve slow and steady. We wanted big-time, hockey-stick growth.<\/p><p>So, we changed course.<\/p><p>When we got to this point, we knew we had an opportunity to really turn up the dial.<\/p><p>If each new piece of content that you publish lands pretty high on SERPs, then it becomes a question of how many pieces of content you can load up–how many unique search terms you can rank for.<\/p><p>This is because the domain authority that you’ve built helps lift each piece of content on your website.<\/p><p><b>More pages = more keywords = more traffic.<\/b><\/p><p>So, we slowed down our production of content aimed at generating links and social traffic and focused more on heads-down production of evergreen content targeted at relevant keywords.<\/p><p>We brainstormed hundreds of article ideas, digging into all of the topics related to the college search and admissions process.<\/p><p>We came up with content ideas by:<\/p><ul><li>Looking at our competitors and identifying gaps<\/li><li>Doing extensive keyword research<\/li><li>Joining forums and communities with our audience asking questions<\/li><li>Sourcing questions from our existing audience<\/li><\/ul><p>Over the course of a few months, we published about 200 articles.<\/p><p>This propelled us to the next level. Up until this point, we had seen a slow and steady growth in traffic.<\/p><p>But this step changed our trajectory.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"740\" data-orig-height=\"255\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/30512f00f3264b35610b5b70bf5f5c2c/tumblr_inline_onhqfg50Kc1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"740\" data-orig-height=\"255\"/><\/figure><p>Now, we had over 300 articles on the site that were all working to bring in search traffic from our target audience on a huge range of relevant topics. Our traffic started to explode. We were growing at 20%-50% per month.<\/p><p>This worked because we had spent the first 8 months focusing almost entirely on earning links. We had generated enough domain authority that each new piece of evergreen content was almost certain to land somewhere on the first page of Google for the target keywords.<\/p><p>It’s worth noting that we didn’t have to do it in this order. We could have spent the first months doing a production sprint and building out a huge catalog of content. Then we could have spent the latter half of the year building links to “raise the ship” on the content that already existed.<\/p><p>The order doesn’t really matter, ultimately. And the results should have been ostensibly the same.<\/p><p>But there can be some strategic advantages to your order of operations.<\/p><p>In this case, we opted to build links first and then focus on building out more content. Since College Raptor had a number of data-driven, programmatic pages, building authority early started to show results right away, even if we didn’t have a lot of search-focused content.<\/p><h2><b>What I Would Have Done Differently<\/b><\/h2><p>Looking back over this year of work, it’s obvious that we accomplished something that many companies and startups only dream of achieving.<\/p><p>But that doesn’t mean we did everything perfectly right.<\/p><p>Although we had a lot of success, this was ultimately one giant learning experience. And I learned a lot.<\/p><p>Here are some of the things I would do differently:<\/p><p><b>1. Work smart(er), not hard(er)<\/b><\/p><p>Like many others, we started out with the assumption that our content really needed to be something special–something no one had ever done before, seen before, or even dreamed of.<\/p><p>We spent hours wracking our brains for ways to twist or layer data to make something <i>new<\/i>.<\/p><p>What I know now is that you don’t need to try to reinvent the wheel every time. There are easy wins to be had by simply looking for what’s been done and making incremental improvements or changes. In some cases, you can even take the exact same premise and put your own spin on it or create your own version. If you’re after links, you might simply do outreach to a different audience.<\/p><p>This doesn’t give you a pass to be lazy. You still need to create great content.<\/p><p>But you can be smart about it and learn from the experience of others.<\/p><p><b>2. Repurpose more<\/b><\/p><p>Another way to make better use of time and resources is to build repurposing into the core of your strategy.<\/p><p>This can take a lot of forms. It may mean creating a series of graphics that work as a big, long infographic and also can be broken down into smaller graphics that are used in a series of text-based posts. It might mean collecting a series of content that’s already published on your site and packaging it up into something “new.”<\/p><p>But, repurposing is a great way to get extra mileage from the work you’ve already done.<\/p><p>Look for opportunities to tie things together or use your assets in different ways or for different audiences.<\/p><p><b>Remember that just because you’ve read something on your site doesn’t mean everyone has.<\/b> So there’s no shame in giving it a second, third, or fourth life.<\/p><p><b>3. Curate content where it works<\/b><\/p><p>It’s tempting to think that if there’s good content out there, you need to set out to make something better–bigger, sexier, more helpful.<\/p><p>But sometimes you should just take what’s already been given.<\/p><p>Notice that I didn’t use this case study to explain to details of how to craft a nice outreach letter or use a tool like Ahrefs to identify link opportunities. That’s because it’s already been done–a lot. So rather than simply rehashing what’s already been created, I just put together <a href=\"https://www.getdrip.com/forms/84769006/submissions/new\" target=\"_blank\">a collection of prerequisite resources<\/a>.<\/p><p>In an age of so much content, sometimes the best thing you can do to add value is to simply serve as a filter.<\/p><p>Curate a list of the best of what’s already out there.<\/p><p>Many of the great content marketing and SEO experts of the world rely heavily on curating lists of other people’s content to provide value to their readers. And they can still use it to generate traffic and links.<\/p><p>Don’t underestimate the power of curation.<\/p><p><b>4. Focus more on design and presentation<\/b><\/p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that looks matter a lot–probably more than you think.<\/p><p>Beyond just having a reasonably designed page, design can play a big role in the success of your outreach and link building. Many times, people won’t even read your content. They’ll skim and try to pick up some of the key points.<\/p><p>They’re busy and they just want to know, “is this a valuable resource of just some spammy junk?”<\/p><p>Having a page with a nice design can set their mind at ease quickly. A wall of text may contain the same information, but it doesn’t feel quite as nice as a well-designed guide with clear bullet points, section headings, and useful graphics.<\/p><p>Content is ultimately only useful it’s also usable.<\/p><h2>Using the “Trifecta Strategy”<\/h2><p>I wanted to share this experience not just to brag about the numbers (although they’re pretty impressive, if I do say so myself). But, because what we learned through this process was that this model–this content marketing strategy–could be applied to almost any business.<\/p><p>Let me be the first to say that it’s not easy.<\/p><p>In fact, it’s damn hard. It takes a ton of work.<\/p><p>But with focus and the right team, this same framework can be applied in nearly any industry–the three (or four) content types are universal.<\/p><p>What changes is the strategic mix of content that you need in order to achieve results.<\/p><p>Here are some tips for adapting this strategy:<\/p><p><b>1. Plan for SEO from the beginning<\/b><\/p><p>This strategy was ultimately so effective at generating huge amounts of search traffic because we went wide and shallow in terms of SEO. We had a huge number of pages related to a broad range of college topics.<\/p><p>If your business relies on ranking highly for a few specific keywords–like, say, an eCommerce store, for example–then your strategy will likely be different. Evergreen content may not be valuable in terms of bringing in traffic that actually converts. So your strategy may focus almost entirely on building links and driving social traffic.<\/p><p>Whatever the case, you must consider the SEO landscape of your industry and then adapt the strategy to help you compete there and achieve your goals.<\/p><p><b>2. Set a benchmark (the 7% rule)<\/b><\/p><p>The general rule for achieving the all-mighty hockey stick is that you should aim for 7% growth, week over week.<\/p><p>The same benchmark generally applies here. We used 7% weekly growth in organic traffic as a goal and it gave us something to chase after and also a way to project what our growth would look like into the future.<\/p><p>You probably won’t hit 7% every week, but if you’re seeing about 7% on average, then you’re probably in good shape.<\/p><p><b>3. Stay strategic<\/b><\/p><p>One of the reasons so many people fail at content marketing is because they lose sight of their strategy.<\/p><p>Instead of focusing on results, they just worry about publishing content–any content. Just to meet some arbitrary schedule or quota. But this is ridiculous.<\/p><p>Content takes time, money, and effort. And if you’re not using it strategically–if you’re blogging just to blog–then it’s simply an expense that isn’t generating a return.<\/p><p>Do what you need to focus on the strategy and make sure that every piece of content that you create and publish is being put to use as an asset. Everything you create should be focused on one of the core objectives of your strategy.<\/p><p>If you can’t immediately say what the purpose of a post would be, then scrap it.<\/p><h2>Essential Reading<\/h2><p>As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, most of our strategy was built on the teachings of many SEO and content marketing experts who generously share their time and knowledge.<\/p><p>People like Neil Patel, Noah Kagan, Robbie Richards, and Brian Dean were all hugely helpful in teaching me some of the fundamental laws of scaling traffic.<\/p><p>Since I didn’t have the opportunity here to rehash all of the specific strategies and tactics that I learned from them, I’ve packaged them up into a collection of essential ideas, strategies, and tactics for anyone who wants to apply this strategy or achieve similar results.<\/p><p><a href=\"denied:javascript:void(0)\" target=\"_blank\">Grab a free copy of this collection of essential reading, tools, and know-how by email<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"778\" data-orig-height=\"131\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/caec69ee8e6852f2b982038dae4fa3cc/tumblr_inline_onhqgqR0Ep1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"778\" data-orig-height=\"131\"/><\/figure>"

I think it is an innocent question, but one which is misguided. Here’s the bubble burster: ideas on their own have little to no value. So while you may be able to find a donation, you do not yet have something which is a good fit for investment capital. For an entrepreneur at the idea-stage, “How do I fund my idea?” is the wrong question. There’s a better question you should be asking: “How do I make my idea worth funding?”<\/p><p>Commercial value is created when <a href=\"https://sivers.org/multiply\" target=\"_blank\">ideas meet execution<\/a>. Scientists may make brilliant discoveries in the lab, but we consumers can’t buy these novel ideas until they’re “commercialized”. When an aspiring entrepreneur comes to me looking to fund his or her idea, it’s often because of the perceived need for capital in order for execution to occur. Yes, it often takes money to develop software or manufacture a product. As someone with a college degree in engineering, I often think that the first step of execution is product development. However, it turns out that you can create value without writing a single line of code or fabricating a widget.<\/p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5402bc0c484735ab0d4d782edd9036ce/tumblr_inline_on7za9Hazg1spm8pc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"400\" data-orig-width=\"800\"/><\/figure><p><br/><\/p><p>In less than 3 days, my friends <a href=\"http://blog.awesomeinc.org/post/68864642042/trying-to-be-like-noah-kaganand-succeeding-1k\" target=\"_blank\">made $1000 in profit<\/a> selling subscriptions to a beef jerky delivery service. They did this without owning any inventory. They had an idea (“It would be cool if you could get high-quality beef jerky delivered to your door each month”), which <a href=\"http://www.appsumo.com/sumo-jerky/\" target=\"_blank\">wasn’t even an original idea<\/a>, and they created value not by building a product, but by validating demand for that product. They made phone calls, sent Facebook messages and emails, and even contacted leads via Tinder. In the case of <a href=\"http://blog.awesomeinc.org/post/68864642042/trying-to-be-like-noah-kaganand-succeeding-1k\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Jerky<\/a>, people were not just vaguely interested in future beef jerky deliveries, but they were specifically interested enough to pre-pay for the service. Then, with cash in hand, the Awesome Jerky team bought their first selection of beef jerky and distributed it to their customers. The started with an idea, then validated it, made sales, and finally built a system to deliver product to their customers.<\/p><p>Now, I’ll admit, sometimes you do need a product before you can sell it. In a subscription retail model like Awesome Jerky, customers know they like they product, it was just a new method of purchasing cured meats. For a brand new product, how can your customer even know what it is? The answer is not a well-polished product, but a Minimum Viable Product. The definition of “minimum viable” depends on your product. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-george-hotz-self-driving-car/\" target=\"_blank\">Minimum Viable Self-Driving Automobile<\/a> is in a different class from <a href=\"http://www.footbridgemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/instant-booster-seat_9-things-300x207.png\" target=\"_blank\">Minimum Viable Booster Seat<\/a>.<\/p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"800\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d961488c22949f7246919314e7d60105/tumblr_inline_on7zbugwCJ1spm8pc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"800\"/><\/figure><p>This reminds me of the story of Foodshoppr, an idea that I helped turn into a business in 2013. My friend Mark is a dad, and with some unique parental insight, he came up with a brilliant idea. For me, as a single guy at the time, grocery shopping was easy: walk into store, grab small basket, shove the same 10–15 items into it as always, pay at self-checkout, go home. There were few surprises, variability, or challenges in my grocery shopping routine. It was quick and easy. Mark’s experience, he and his wife with three kids in-tow, was much different. A typical Sunday afternoon grocery trip for him involved one child crying loudly, another trying to run away, and the remaining kiddo tossing sugary cereals into the cart. This two-hour endeavor was not seldom fun, and barely productive, for Mark and his family. He wanted to find a way to make grocery shopping better for families.<\/p><p>Mark reflected on the ways to improve grocery shopping. His issue was not the convenience of the location of the stores. He had no problem loading the kids up in the car, or even coming home and unloading the bags of groceries from his trunk. His beef was with the store experience: going inside, wandering the aisles, and waiting in the checkout lines — all while managing a small flock of children. So, Mark’s idea was to shop and pay from home, just going to the shore to pick up pre-bagged groceries. To do this, he decided to turn his iPad into a visual shopping device. Since Mark is not a software developer, he came to me and my friends to make that happen.<\/p><p>When you’re an engineer, it’s easy to think the first step in turning an idea into reality is to develop your product. For a software product, this meant writing code. After a few weeks of wireframes, crisp mockups, and iOS app prototypes, we had made progress, but weren’t ready to help people buy groceries. Then, my friend and Awesome Inc co-founder Luke Murray asked me an important question: “What if you had to finish it tonight?” Luke challenged me to build the entire product in under two hours. What happened from this creative constraint has defined how I’ve approached ideas ever since.<\/p><p>We built Foodshoppr, running the service for three months for a few dozen paying customers, without writing a single line of code. Instead, we cobbled together a bunch of off-the-shelf systems and services into our “product”:<\/p><ul><li>Domain from GoDaddy<\/li><li>Google Form to collect customer info<\/li><li>Text Messaging to schedule pickups<\/li><li>Google Calendar to internally keep track of schedule<\/li><li>An existing grocery list sharing app to select food items<\/li><li>Square to process credit card payments<\/li><li>Google Sheets to internally keep track of payments<\/li><\/ul><p>To build this as an iOS app would have taken months of time, and well over $10,000 if we were paying someone else to develop it. Instead, it took under two hours, and no up-front cash. To your customers, your product is nothing more than an experience. They don’t notice servers, app version numbers, or the hours you took designing button shapes and writing code. They just want to use it to gain value. So figure out whatever it takes for your idea to start providing value to your customers, a process called <a href=\"http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/what-is-customer-development.html\" target=\"_blank\">Customer Development<\/a>, and do that first.<\/p><p>If you have an idea, my team at <a href=\"https://www.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc<\/a> would like to help point you in the right direction. We’re not going to fund your idea, but we can help you create value by taking the first few (often free) steps in validating and executing your idea.

The stage was officially set for the 2017 kickoff to the 5across pitch competition hosted by Awesome Inc. This was my first time experiencing what seemed like a now legendary event. I had only heard rumors of what to expect, and now I finally had the opportunity to experience the event for myself.<br/><br/><\/p><p>Anticipation weighed heavily in the air, the unmistakable smell of entrepreneurship filled the room. The stakes were suddenly real; it was winner take all. By the end of the night, another 5across champion would be crowned.<\/p><p>The first of the competitors was Think Hempy Thoughts, a group focusing on propelling the local hemp market into a sustainable and profitable business model. The next presenter hailed from Aqui, a group who’s currently developing an incentivized attendance software to provided high school students a new sense of motivation to be present in class. <br/><\/p><p>Although the first two pitches set the bar high, the next half of challengers would prove to be worthy opponents. Bluegrass Robotics, LLC set their sights on the technology of the future, using their expertise to design and engineer a new way for military vehicles to perform when driving across extreme terrain conditions. <br/><br/><\/p><p>Welcome Home, the next of the 5across chosen ones, brought an international flair to the event when they introduced their software to facilitate a safe and reliable way for international students and travelers to communicate with landlords before they arrive in the states. <br/><br/>To cap off the night, Modern Testament presented their entrepreneurial model for offering a social networking platform for Christian youth to connect and share motivational testimony with others in their spiritual community. <br/><br/><\/p><p>Once the last of the 5across challengers had concluded their pitch, the judges left the room to deliberate a winner. The night had proven to be an exciting experience. The 2017 kickoff to 5across lived up to the legend, filled with big ideas, supportive energy, and an unbelievable entrepreneurial spirit. The decision to crown a victor would not be an easy one to make.<br/><br/><\/p><p>After heated deliberation, the judges returned to present Welcome Home the next 5across champion, the first of the 2017 winners, but certainly not the last. The 5across legend is to continue April, 26th. <\/p>"

Awesome Inc staff, interns, startup founders, spouses, and friends alike strived to discover the answer to “Why do I and my company exist?” We then examined the effect of this “why” on the “how” and the “what” of ourselves and our ideas. Each entry in the slate of sessions for the weekend spoke to this question, some by real-world training in the “how” and others by the refocusing of the “what.” But as Simon Sinek <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">so eloquently put it,<\/a> the best companies “start with the why.”<\/p><p>In accordance with this philosophy, the first session of the weekend was “Your Why Has to be Stronger”, presented by Awesome Inc co-founder Brian Raney. He emphasized that the importance of discovering the why behind your work far exceeds the importance of the how or the what in entrepreneurship. Every organization knows what they do, the products they sell or the services they provide. Some even know how they will do it better than their competitors and leverage their competitive advantage. Very few have sought to understand why they find what they do a worthwhile use of their time and efforts. Yet this is what sets successful companies and entrepreneurs apart. This is because we will fail, sometimes very often, at what we do or how we do it. If there is not a strong reason why, there is no inspiration or drive to overcome the obstacles that inhibit the how and the what.  <\/p><p>Awesome Inc has spent years discovering the why for itself. Today, we can say that Awesome Inc exists to help people pursue their definition of awesome. That is why we devote our time to building a high-tech startup community in Kentucky with our various initiatives like the <a href=\"https://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Fellowship<\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.awesomeincu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc U<\/a>. Without that why, whenever an initiative flopped (there have been a few), we would become stuck, because we failed at our what. But because our purpose is to help people, we still succeed, because even in those failures we are helping people in their pursuit of Awesome. For entrepreneurs, this has to be the same. The why can’t be money, because the reality is not all companies end up making money. But if the purpose is to fill a need, a passion to create change, then the why is strong enough.<\/p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"234\" data-orig-width=\"640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33cdd54a39032dfe7170d699b67ab427/tumblr_inline_ocs7cmGnlP1spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"234\" data-orig-width=\"640\"/><\/figure><p>Each of the sessions that followed contributed to this theme.

The Bootcamp is taught by experienced developers with industry experience, with a focus on quickly moving from basic skills to hands-on projects. High job placement rates (close to 100%) are the target for these programs.<\/p><p><br/>Companies and organizations in the Lexington area are hungry for employees with Information Technology talent. One of the greatest needs is for people who can build web applications using open-source technologies.

I’m not just thinking of the obvious rules like, “Don’t go over the speed limit”, “Don’t take that on the plane”, or “Don’t enter through that door”.  But subtle rules of society like, “If you don’t follow these steps you can’t be successful”.<\/p><p>There is a reason why the first rule in the list of Awesome Inc rules is: “All rules are meant to be bent or broken.”<\/p><p>When Luke and I set out to start Awesome Inc we wanted to create a place where people could challenge the status quo and be around other people that wanted more than just a “normal” life.<\/p><p>To quote a cartoon character from Kung Fu Panda, “If you only do what you think you can do you will never be more than you are now”.  Awesome Inc is meant to be a place where people (not just ideas) grow.  Growth can be uncomfortable.  It can be scary, risky, and often involves lots of failure along the way.  I recall Jon Weece, lead pastor at Southland Christian Church, saying, “We aren’t called to live a safe life.”  <\/p><p>I believe that to my core.  A safe life isn’t conducive to growth.  Communities aren’t transformed by it’s people playing it safe or doing the “normal thing”.  <\/p><p>If our purpose at Awesome Inc is to help people pursue their own definition of awesome, then we must create an environment where people are pushed out of their comfort zone to identify and go after their dreams.  Success is praised, but failure needs to be an acceptable outcome.  The only unacceptable behavior is not trying.  <\/p><p><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- Our Core Values &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<\/b><\/p><p>You can’t build a great organization on a weak foundation.  The longevity of anything in this world is dependent upon being built on solid foundation.  One of the reasons I am so confident in our longevity and future success is that everything we are doing is built upon the foundation of our core values.  No matter what current or new initiative we choose to spend our time on, these four core values will be at the heart of it.  Every decision we make, every action we take, every obstacle we overcome is centered around the four core values below.  <\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"8299\" data-orig-height=\"3599\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d8ba0abc8c5bb26f59adac1589059ff1/tumblr_inline_o1uoxsJDqP1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"8299\" data-orig-height=\"3599\"/><\/figure><p>\n\n<b><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7gvSUP1jLhgbVJRNzY3OVlIYm8/view\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><\/b>\n\n<br/><\/p><p>This in and of itself is exciting.  But even more exciting is the idea that we get to spread our core values throughout the community as we build our organization up.  And by spreading these core values we make the community a better place to live and work within.  <\/p><p>As our sphere of influence expands and our organization grows it becomes increasingly more important to not only have a solid foundation built upon these core values but also to reinforce that foundation regularly.  We must consistently revisit these four words and trust that by following them in our work and living them out daily in our actions we are maximizing the potential of achieving our goals.<\/p><p><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Our Team / Transitions &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;<\/b><\/p><p>The thing that I am by far the most proud of at Awesome Inc is our people.  We’ve built an incredible team of high potential individuals that deserve all the credit for our success.<\/p><p>When you join the team at Awesome Inc you’re not just accepting a job.  You’re adopting a lifestyle.  Core Value #3 at Awesome Inc is “Be a Friend”.  This means that we do more than just work together.  We live our lives together.  We have fun together.  We hold each other accountable to our goals.  We make each other better people.  <\/p><p>Our team has experienced some growth and change over the past year.  <\/p><p>My favorite part of my job is getting to work with and develop the outstanding people that come through the doors of Awesome Inc.  This inevitably leads to the least favorite part of my job which is from time to time watching those people move onto pursue their dreams in a place other than Awesome Inc.  <\/p><p>I don’t have kids, but I imagine the feeling of having your kids move away after landing their dream job or being accepted to their favorite college is a similar feeling.  It’s a feeling of sadness, but at the same time an incredible sense of pride and happiness for that individual.  <\/p><p>This year, we got to help several team members pursue their definition of awesome.  Melo (formerly known as Melanie) was a team member of Awesome Inc for two years doing design work and then later served as an assistant director.  Maggie was our designer for over a year at Awesome Inc.  Both found great opportunities and are we’re very proud to have them representing the Awesome Inc alumni in their respective positions.  Melanie and Maggie’s DNA is all all over the brand of Awesome Inc and it will forever be passed onto anything we pursue.<\/p><p>Garrett is another key member of the Awesome Inc team that has been with us off and on for 5 years.  With the help of Awesome Inc he found his passion in construction.  He is now killing it for a local construction and building company, Andover Construction.  The work Garrett did for Awesome Inc will live on through the cultural impact he has had with Team Alpha and the physical impact he has had on our space.  <\/p><p>There are many others that Awesome Inc has had to say goodbye to in 2015 and each of them played an important role in getting us to where we are today.<\/p><p>We also ushered in several new team members in 2015.  We hired a new Director of Operations, Emily Andrews.  Emily has been with us for 3 months now and is already playing a critical role in managing the co-working space, managing team alpha, and taking over events like 5 Across and the Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame.  Brittany Durham joined our team in November as our designer.  Her imprint was immediately made as she developed designs for the Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame, Awesome Fellowship, and several APAX projects.  The APAX team added several new team members including Senior Developers Chris Allen and Wei-Keat Kong as well as Junior Developers Dustin Peerce and Ashir Amin.  Team Alpha is strong in the “Calipari Era”, constantly reloading talent and high potential team members.<\/p><p>As our organization continues to grow we will work to find a long term place for some of our team members and assist others in finding a place where their ambitions and passions take them.<\/p><p>And no matter where any Awesome Inc’er ends up, we will forever follow CV #3 with each other.  <\/p><p><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Updates on each of our primary initiatives &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;<\/b><br/><\/p><p>We’ve had a very successful year at Awesome Inc.  All of our initiatives have reached or exceeded the goals that we set at the beginning of 2015.  Everyone on this team plays a critical part in the success of each of these initiatives and the success of each of these initiatives leads to us to furthering our purpose of being able to help more people in the community pursue their passion.  The success of these initiatives also makes our community stronger and Lexington a better place to live and work.  As I mentioned earlier, our team deserves all the credit for this success.<\/p><p>Here is a quick overview of the progress each of our primary initiatives have made in 2015.<\/p><p><b>APAX Software<\/b><\/p><p>Our oldest and most mature company, APAX Software, is a cornerstone for the impact that the Awesome Inc community is able to make.<\/p><p>The team members at APAX are the unsung heroes for the startup community in Kentucky.  Year after year this team moves forward like a steady, consistent machine.  MLB player Cal Ripken, Jr. (aka “The Iron Man”) played a record setting 2,632 games in a row&hellip;but he has nothing on the APAX team when it comes to consistency.

Expect even more exciting things from this team in 2016.<\/p><p><b>Awesome Inc U<\/b><\/p><p>We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn to code.  And those that do will have an inherent advantage in the future economy.  <\/p><p>Nick Such, founder of Awesome Inc and Director of Awesome Inc U, leads the efforts of our coding school which we launched 2.5 years ago.  This year, the one metric that matters for Awesome Inc U was student-hours taught.  We had a goal of 2,856.  In 2015 we taught 2,880 student-hours.  This initiative experienced a 20% increase in revenue and for the first year was profitable.<\/p><p>The future direction of Awesome Inc U will continue to include our offerings for K-12 students as well as an additional focus on teaching adults advanced programming.  Awesome Inc U has plans to launch a 3 month intense bootcamp for adults interested in computer programming as a profession.  The bootcamp will teach participants various programming languages and by the end of the 3 months find them a job as a junior developer with an employer partner.  The below graphic is the inspiration for the launch of the Awesome Inc U bootcamp.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"1771\" data-orig-height=\"1048\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b831470bd3c2581222c84cca90dfdcd8/tumblr_inline_o1up22Xij01spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1771\" data-orig-height=\"1048\"/><\/figure><p>Congratulations to the Awesome Inc U team on a great year!<\/p><p><b>Awesome Fellowship<\/b><\/p><p>The Awesome Fellowship Program is another initiative at Awesome Inc that is thriving.  The Awesome Fellowship Program is our flagship program for supporting entrepreneurs.  A competitive application process on the front end and a rigorous year of mentorship, accountability, and training sessions create an experience of a lifetime for the participating startups.  Coming off it’s second year, the portfolio of companies that the Fellowship Program supports is impressive.  To date, 14 companies have participated in the program.  Those companies have created over 40 jobs and raised over $2.5M of outside funding.<\/p><p>The program sets (and crushes) annual fundraising goals of it’s own as well.  In 2015, the program was fully funded by the end of Q1.  Going into the new year, the program is almost already fully funded for 2016.<\/p><p>Congratulations to the Awesome Fellowship team on another solid year!<\/p><p><b>Awesome Inc<\/b><\/p><p>The core Awesome Inc team supports all of the aforementioned initiatives as well as everything else that we do.

Building a startup community is a 20 year journey and we’re just getting started.  Awesome Inc turns 7 years old in 2016.  <\/p><p><b><\/b><\/p><p>If you’re still reading this then you’re the exact kind of person we want to get involved in the startup community.  It’s likely you believe deep down in what we are doing and are motivated to keep growing the high tech startup community in Kentucky.  We will depend on you even more than ever as we embark into the next stage of our journey.  With the help of people like you we’ve created something really special over the last several years and it is now time to take it to the next level.<\/p><p>Nothing incredible happens from the efforts of a single person.  It takes a team working towards a common goal to accomplish greatness.  Lastly, this means higher expectations both internally and externally.  The community is going to expect more from us and we need to expect more from ourselves.  <\/p><p>A few areas of focus that will get us to the next level:<\/p><ol><li>\n\nA culture of excellence - In 2016, we need to continue to focus on ways to raise the bar in everything we do.  How do we attract more high potential team members?  How do we increase our productivity on a daily basis?  How do we make an even bigger impact?  How do we stay hungry and passionate about what we’re doing?  The answer to these questions leads to a culture of excellence and CV #2 demands nothing less of our organization.<br/><br/><\/li><li>\n\nFanatic Discipline - Discipline is the consistency of action.  Jim Collins, author of Great By Choice, write about how the most successful companies have the “inner will to do whatever it takes to be great”.  This type of discipline is self-discipline and it’s fanatic.  It involves setting, measuring, and being relentless in achieving performance markers that are ambitious but also within your control to reach.  These performance markers must be achieved with great consistency.  Trying hard or having good intentions doesn’t count.  Remember - whatever it takes to be great.\n\n<\/li><\/ol><p>If this sounds like the type of journey that you want to be on then I look forward to sharing an exciting, adventurous, and rewarding 2016 with you.<\/p><p>Rule #4: Always do something awesome over something not awesome!<br/><br/><\/p><p>Best,<br/>Brian Raney<br/>Founder, Awesome Inc<\/p>"

Most of the time people just need permission to try something.  We live in a world where more and more rules are being created and where it’s more and more advised to play it safe.  People constantly tell you that you shouldn’t do this or you can’t do that.  I’m not just thinking of the obvious rules like, “Don’t go over the speed limit”, “Don’t take that on the plane”, or “Don’t enter through that door”.  But subtle rules of society like, “If you don’t follow these steps you can’t be successful”.<\/p><p>There is a reason why the first rule in the list of Awesome Inc rules is: “All rules are meant to be bent or broken.”<\/p><p>When Luke and I set out to start Awesome Inc we wanted to create a place where people could challenge the status quo and be around other people that wanted more than just a “normal” life.<\/p><p>To quote a cartoon character from Kung Fu Panda, “If you only do what you think you can do you will never be more than you are now”.

Awesome Inc has always been about developing these three communities - Entrepreneurship, Technology, and Creativity.  Over the past few years we’ve started to shift more towards the first two words.  We will continue to mesh the three words together, but the market opportunity for us lies in the intersection of entreprepreneurship and technology.  The state of Kentucky already thinks of Awesome Inc when “entrepreneurship” is mentioned.  Next, we must get our brand to be tightly connected to the word “technology”&hellip;specifically, “software”.<\/p><p><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- Our Core Values &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-<\/b><\/p><p>You can’t build a great organization on a weak foundation.

Going into the new year, the program is almost already fully funded for 2016.<\/p><p>The Fellowship Program is led by Theresa Simcic and her team includes Kyle Raney (Developer), Peter Briggs (Video Editor), and Brittany Durham (Graphic Designer).  <\/p><p>Congratulations to the Awesome Fellowship team on another solid year!<\/p><p><b>Awesome Inc<\/b><\/p><p>The core Awesome Inc team supports all of the aforementioned initiatives as well as everything else that we do.  This includes things like the co-working space, the events we host, our internship program (Team Alpha), and other community outreach programs.  Basically, everything you see in this (hard to see) graphic below.  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx_Q0BT9EMjOVUh6alZwRE02Y00/view\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for larger view<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"1728\" data-orig-height=\"1296\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a8ed83408017ba016c1c948ce66ff661/tumblr_inline_o1up3p8znz1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1728\" data-orig-height=\"1296\"/><\/figure><p>The core team at Awesome Inc includes the Director of Operations, Emily Andrews, our Director of Good, Elzaba Mathews, every single team alpha member, and our Space Maintenance Director, “Pete the Painter”.<\/p><p>Here are a few key metrics for 2015 for a few of the initiatives:<\/p><p>Co-working space - 16 companies served<br/>5 Across - 6, events, 30 pitches<br/>Entrepreneur Hall of Fame - 4 new inductees, 2 new emerging entrepreneurs, 250 attendees<br/>Startup Weekend - 45 participants, 7 teams formed<br/>Cherub Fund - 3 investments<br/>Joy Project - 2 projects completed<\/p><p><b>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; What’s next &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;<\/b><\/p><p>The future looks bright for Awesome Inc and its mission.  Building a startup community is a 20 year journey and we’re just getting started.  Awesome Inc turns 7 years old in 2016.  <\/p><p>If you’re still reading this then you’re the exact kind of person we want on our team.  It’s likely you believe deep down in what we are doing and are motivated to keep growing our sphere of influence.  We will depend on you even more than ever as we embark into the next stage of our journey.  We’ve created something really special over the last several years and it is now time to take it to the next level.<\/p><p>This means more intentional use of our time, money, and other resources.  We must continue to try to new things, but be even more strategic in our methods and not be afraid to pull the plug on things quickly if they aren’t working.  This means more team and less I.  Nothing incredible happens from the efforts of a single person.  It takes a team working towards a common goal to accomplish greatness.  Lastly, this means higher expectations both internally and externally.  The community is going to expect more from us and we need to expect more from ourselves.  <\/p><p>A few areas of focus that will get us to the next level:<\/p><ol><li>\n\nA culture of excellence - Unless you somehow snuck through our application process, if you made it onto the team at Awesome Inc you are likely one of the hardest working people in this city.  In 2016, we need to continue to focus on ways to raise the bar in everything we do.  How do we attract more high potential team members?  How do we increase our productivity on a daily basis?  How do we make an even bigger impact?  How do we stay hungry and passionate about what we’re doing?  The answer to these questions leads to a culture of excellence and CV #2 demands nothing less of our organization.<br/><br/><\/li><li>\n\nStorytelling - “All steak, no sizzle”.  That’s what most outsiders say when they really get to know Awesome Inc.  They can’t believe how much our team is able to get accomplished in a year&hellip;and how little they knew about everything we do before really diving in.  Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t ever want to be an organization that is accused of “No steak, All sizzle”.  However, we need to do a better job of sharing our story with the community around us, including our potential customers.  We have amazing opportunities to teach people how to code - the community needs to know that so anyone interested in learning can join our classes.  We have the best software development company in the state - everyone needs to know that so we can help build their products.  We have the best pitch contest in the state - entrepreneurs and wantrepreneurs need to know that so they can participate or attend to get involved.<br/><br/>Storytelling needs to be a focus for all of our initiatives in 2016.<br/><br/><\/li><li>\n\nFanatic Discipline - Discipline is the consistency of action.  Jim Collins, author of Great By Choice, write about how the most successful companies have the “inner will to do whatever it takes to be great”.  This type of discipline is self-discipline and it’s fanatic.  It involves setting, measuring, and being relentless in achieving performance markers that are ambitious but also within your control to reach.  These performance markers must be achieved with great consistency.  Trying hard or having good intentions doesn’t count.  Remember - whatever it takes to be great.\n\n<\/li><\/ol><p>If this sounds like the type of journey that you want to be on then I look forward to sharing an exciting, adventurous, and rewarding 2016 with you.<\/p><p>Rule #4: Always do something awesome over something not awesome!<br/><br/><\/p><p>Best,<br/>Brian Raney<br/>Founder, Awesome Inc<\/p>"

Consequently, the cost of trying to save products that have decreased in popularity has prompted many American businesses to move their manufacturing operations overseas.<br/><br/>So, what kind of options does an entrepreneur have when the parts for your car or favorite blue jean button begins to cost more to make than it does to discontinue the item?<br/><br/>When “something new and better” comes along, how much more should an organization continue to invest into the production of an item? But more importantly, how many resource and energy expenditures factor into the decision to finally cut the cord?<br/><br/>American entrepreneur Drura Parrish, CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://maketime.io/\" target=\"_blank\">MakeTime<\/a> may have just found a way to revolutionize the way American manufacturers manage their supply chain so they don&rsquo;t have to worry about those kinds of concerns anymore.<\/p><p>By creating an online marketplace in which manufacturers can buy and sell unused machine time on cnc machines like lathes, mills, routers, and plasma cutters, MakeTime has created a way for manufacturers to create &ndash; and even save &ndash;  some of your favorite brands.<\/p><p>MakeTime&rsquo;s innovative new platform allows manufacturers to monetize their idle machine time and to manage their supply chain within a flexible, transparent network of vendors in a way that minimizes waste and unnecessary production expenses. <\/p><p>By creating ways for machines to generate revenue once a product is no longer popular, companies can also reduce advertising costs associated with discounting products once the production on those items begins to decline.<\/p><p>This “sharing economy” of the manufacturing sector also creates more opportunities for small businesses access to a network of over 400 pre-qualified suppliers who have already have the equipment, skilled staff, and legal protocols in place needed to provide literally the same level of quality assurance and credibility as a more established brand. <\/p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2490\" data-orig-width=\"3741\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f5a52e251677004d1c84a0ecaace6a6f/tumblr_inline_nvi61iGHuq1spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"2490\" data-orig-width=\"3741\"/><\/figure><p>By helping established manufacturers generate revenue on equipment that would have lost revenue in the late stages of production, Drura&rsquo;s model enables small businesses to ensure a better quality of control while simultaneously eliminating capital expenditure, excess inventory, utility costs, and risks through the symbiotic relationship. The platform creates an elegant solution to the accounting questions associated with idle machines and unused supply versus entrepreneurs&rsquo; limited resources and growing demands. <\/p><p>Drura’s platform could be incredibly useful for start up organizations, fab labs, solar powered manufacturing plants, and makers who may need to contract smaller quantities or custom parts on-demand. <\/p><p>Parrish has positioned his data driven model to serve as a powerful alternative to the traditional RFQ-based transaction model.<\/p><p>Drura Parrish launched the MakeTime site in 2014 in order to encourage manufacturers to reuse their manufacturing equipment and empower them to expand their production capabilities at a more flexible scale. <\/p><p>Parrish has an award winning background in digital fabrication, object-based economics, and design.<\/p><p>Despite the disruptive implications of his business model, Drura’s maturity and dynamic focus comes across as very down to earth. <\/p><p>Parrish formerly taught Architecture at Columbia, UCLA, Southern California Institute of Architecture, University of Kentucky, at Lund University in Sweden.<\/p><p>It&rsquo;s very apparent when meeting Parrish that he definitely loves his work. <\/p><p>Drura shares how his professional background and desire to help other innovators meet an unmet need, shaped his path as an entrepreneur.<\/p><p>“I love this. If you look at the market network of Architecture which is a huge project, twenty five million other projects, like materials, shipping, etc. I wanted to surround the project and be good at the things that architects need so I can position myself. That brought me back into manufacturing. I grew up in a manufacturing family. I was a bit of a shop rat if you will. <\/p><p>“I worked as a senior vice president of a 3d printing company. It was the largest in the nation and my whole job was business development. <\/p><p>“I kind of got tired of the whole corporate thing and started running into a narrative where in America there is this belief in a certain value system and a certain economic outcome if you put enough labor into it, you will succeed, but it wasn’t panning out. <\/p><p>“I would go into shop after shop and see a capital investment of 15 million dollars, but none of the machines were on. So that just meant that somebody was carrying debt and making somebody rich, but nobody was making money. <\/p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"960\" data-orig-width=\"639\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/91cb32e3fceb2933d9351924ba9dd7cc/tumblr_inline_nvi62q5nHW1spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"960\" data-orig-width=\"639\"/><\/figure><p>“Instead of just dealing with it, I would say, hey let me buy all your machine time, on this one machine that’s dead, for the entire month. Tell me how much it is, (I&rsquo;ll pay) cost plus ten percent and I would buy it. Then I would run around and grab artists, designers and whoever and say &lsquo;use this machine, you may never have a chance to use it again&rsquo; and then kind of activated it. <\/p><p>“I took this pain point for designers and artists, people who don’t have access to stuff, and I took this idle machine time and brought them together. All the love that I had for architecture started to dissolve into this abstract business concept which was basically one thing. <\/p><p>“People love to make things and use things. It’s implicit in our drive as humans, and there has to be a way to do these things, but these things don’t always line up.<\/p><p>“So then I started working in boutique fabrication, which I laid out for 10 years while I was teaching. <\/p><p>“An investment banker saw what I was doing and saw that this was a repeatable model and we put it on the web. So now you have MakeTime.”<\/p>",

This falls under Core Value #3: be a Friend. We believe that a great undertaking isn’t done alone, and even if it could be, we aren’t interested in doing it that way. We exist to serve others. We work next to others in pursuit of this vision. We want to connect with others who care about what we care about.<br/><\/p><p>For these reasons Awesome Inc makes it a point to set aside time to spend with each other in non “work” related activities. Some companies may call it team building - to us it’s simply spending time with our friends. In the past we have come together to participate in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc4PLEBwJ8o&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc Olympics<\/a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2Fawesomeinc%2Fsets%2F72157630437641088&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNECBBEiGQk2p3YybLGUxEW7PnESiA\" target=\"_blank\">spelunking trips<\/a>, game nights, and of course March Madness viewings (sans couch burning).<\/p><p>Most recently 20 of us took part in an adventure of a lifetime on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Most of our “be a friend” time is spent on adventures rather than sitting back and relaxing and this trip was no different. While on the island, 12 of us decided to partake in the challenge of kayaking the secluded Na Pali Coast. This is an epic 17-mile, 2-day trip referred to as the “Mount Everest” of sea kayaking.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"592\" data-orig-height=\"437\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/84c78628d4ac3e8076bdc706efeab8b3/tumblr_inline_ns9k6xM5I81spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"592\" data-orig-height=\"437\"/><\/figure><p><i>Awesome Inc co-founder, Nick Such, kayaking the waters of the Na Pali Coast.<\/i><\/p><p>On the first day we were led by two guides who taught us how to navigate the coastline. They were preparing us for the second day during which we would continue the trip maverick style, without guides. I have never witnessed the act of being a friend (CV #3) lived out more truly than on this kayak trip. <\/p><p>One of the largest hurdles we faced on this trip was the poor weather and subsequent rough surf, which was described by locals as an anomaly for this time of year. On the first day some members of our team suffered greatly from sea sickness as our tiny boats lifted and quickly dropped with each swell. As one member in particular was incapacitated from seasickness, I witnessed her partner take full responsibility for solo paddling the large kayak that was intended to be paddled by two people. He never once complained about this burden and while the rest of us took a break he continued paddling in order to get his seasick passenger to shore as quickly as possible. <\/p><p>At the end of day one the guides helped us manage the extremely difficult challenge of landing on a remote beach during large and strong surf conditions. After accomplishing this task they gave us some tips for our morning launch, wished us luck, and paddled back to sea. We spent that evening discussing with the few inhabitants of the beach the pros and cons of spending another night on shore if the surf was too strong in the morning. <\/p><p>The next morning we awoke to the brightness of the sun on the horizon. It was 5:30 am and we needed to move if we wanted to make it out before the ocean became too strong. Despite several locals approaching us and warning us not to launch because of the size of the surf, we decided to move forward. Not only did we successfully launch our six kayaks, we also helped launch two other kayaks consisting of four additional people who spent the night on the beach and were struggling to get back on the ocean. During this process I witnessed two of my coworkers push every single one of these kayaks through the surf, get knocked down by the immense waves, and swim back to shore. All the while the rest of us rode as passengers in the boats paddling as hard as we could. We would not have been able to pass through the crashing waves if it was not for the additional hands pushing our boat off shore.<br/><\/p><p>The same situation repeated itself during our landing on the second day. This kayak adventure was just one example of how everyone on the trip showcased CV #3 throughout our time on the island. We also had to come together as one of us suffered a knee injury, another had a family emergency, and others needed some extra encouragement on a grueling hike. <\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"618\" data-orig-height=\"552\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e2063de2a3d6278545d7768cbb908b56/tumblr_inline_ns9k5njYD41spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"618\" data-orig-height=\"552\"/><\/figure><p><i>At the completion of the 17-mile sea kayak - exhausted and happy!<\/i><\/p><p>Whether we are launching our kayaks through the raging surf of Kalalau Beach in Hawaii or tackling the problem of too few programmers in Lexington, my coworkers and I are facing these problems with each other, knowing that there is no one out there that will fight harder than the person standing next to us. We know this because of the strength of our relationships as a result of following CV #3 - be a friend.  <\/p>",

Awesome Inc U and 5 Across are two of our favorite things, but once you walk into Awesome Inc, you might be surprised to see kids in tutus, people trying to build houses and Team Alpha members running around with Nerf guns.<b><br/><\/b><\/p><p>We do a lot of things at Awesome Inc and one of those things is provide coworking spaces for people and their companies. One of our tenants is Leslie Guttman, a freelance journalist and a nonfiction writer who has been featured on NPR and publications across the United States.<\/p><p>Since January, Leslie and her poodle Daisy have become a big part of our Awesome Inc family. Leslie comes to our family lunches, where everyone involved at Awesome Inc comes together to eat good food and spend time together. Garrett, our Director of Daily Activities, says that she is always willing to give advice and loves discussing old school rap with Jay Hamilton.<\/p><p>Leslie became a tenant to avoid the isolation that can come along with being a writer. You can often see Leslie typing away at her next article on our couches with Daisy curled up by her feet, both of them comfortable in the craziness that is Awesome Inc. Leslie said that she enjoys the fast-paced and high tech environment and being surrounded by people who take risks every day. <\/p><p>When Leslie isn’t at Awesome Inc, she spends her time writing stories and visiting people across the great Commonwealth of Kentucky. She also works with the Carnegie Center as a writing tutor and helps other writers improve their manuscripts.<\/p><p>“I enjoy the privilege of being let into people’s lives. It’s great. It involves a lot of trust and it’s a lot of responsibility,” Leslie said about her job as a writer.<\/p><p>Fun for Leslie is working on whatever story has caught her attention. She once wrote a story about a man who turned <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/07/21/333553656/to-save-these-pigs-ky-farmer-says-we-have-to-eat-them\" target=\"_blank\">saving an endangered species of pigs<\/a> into a full time job. When she was writing her book, Equine ER, Leslie spent a year following veterinarians around Kentucky.<\/p><p>“It’s definitely fun when your work involves driving around beautiful horse country,” Leslie said.<\/p><p>Leslie has had a few other adventures recently. One example is an article she wrote on Hopewell Presbyterian Church in Paris, Kentucky, where they <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=213266284\" target=\"_blank\">let parishioners bring their dogs to church<\/a>. Leslie’s articles are frequently featured on NPR and working in radio is an adventure in and of itself, it would seem, especially to members of our blog team at Awesome Inc. In journalism, quotes are considered the most important parts of an article and plenty of writers have been told that their quotes aren’t good enough. So, when Leslie read her story to her editor and he told her the story “needs more barking,” Leslie laughed it off and went out to record more dog barks for her piece.<\/p><p>Like we mentioned before, Leslie gives great advice. Her definition of “Awesome” is treating everyone the way you want to be treated, because it can open doors and help you find what works for you in life and your professional career. Leslie’s other advice is “fall down seven times, get up 8,” and in an environment full of startups, we think that is some awesome advice. <\/p><p>You can read more of Leslie’s stories and check out her book at her <a href=\"http://leslieguttman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a>.<\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p>By: Sam Razor, Awesome Fellowship member with <a href=\"http://hippomanager.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hippo Manager Software<\/a><\/p><p>May and June have been, for lack of a better word, awesome at Awesome Inc.  <br/><\/p><p>When you own your own business, sometimes the highs are high and the lows can be low. It’s important to stop and declare victory so you can remember the good when the bad comes, so I will (not so humbly) brag that so far, it has been a summer of growth for us, and I can trace several of our “wins” back to our connections at Awesome Inc.  <\/p><p>1. We took home 2nd place (and a cash prize) in the Kentucky Innovation Network/Kentucky Angel Investors Pitch Contest.  A big shout out to Theresa, Brian and Melanie for helping me refine and rework our pitch.<\/p><p>2. The legal and marketing services have come in handy more than once, and helped us save our cash flow for contract software developers who are helping us prepare for our next huge release of new features.<\/p><p>3. BizLex published a short article about Hippo Manager.  <a href=\"http://bizlex.com/2015/06/local-company-makes-a-splash-in-veterinary-world-with-hippo-manager/\" target=\"_blank\">Check it out here<\/a>.  It never ceases to amaze me how Lexington embraces the startup community.  <\/p><p>4. We are in the process of fleshing out several new partnerships and we added two new veterinary clinics just this week.<\/p><p>Awesome Inc has been by our side every step of the way this spring and summer, and sometimes I needed them even when I didn’t know I needed them.  While we have used the big ticket services offered through the <a href=\"http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Fellowship<\/a>, it’s important to mention that they also offer some simple, business infrastructure as well.  Last week, I was working on some documents that required me to scan a multi-page document and I didn’t want to waste time at my home office on my one-page scanner.  As I was out running errands, I ran into a copy store to use their scanner, but had sticker shock at the price tag.  I left, resigned to wasting a lot of time manually scanning this huge document, and when I walked out the door, across the street, like a beacon on a hill, stood the Awesome Inc office.  I have to admit, I laughed at myself for not thinking of it as my tool of first resort.  There are so many benefits of being an Awesome Inc Fellowship company that I simply forgot about the basic office infrastructure they provide.  That simple office infrastructure is huge in terms in time saving (and cash flow saving).<\/p><p>So, what’s new with your startup this summer?  How do you stop and declare victory when you are having a good month?<\/p><p><br/><\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"844\" data-orig-height=\"475\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/99b907bc470dc85d8118a2731414ae28/tumblr_inline_nqpve7YvCB1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"844\" data-orig-height=\"475\"/><\/figure><p><i>We aren’t the only Hippo growing this summer.

      "regular-body": "<p>By: Brian Raney<\/p><p>My company, <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc<\/a>, has one of the most competitive internship application processes I’ve seen.  It’s a four-step process, with each step getting progressively harder.  I’ve had a lot of friends (with good paying jobs) tell me that there is no way they would go through the Awesome Inc internship interview process for a high-paying, salaried job, much less for an unpaid internship.  I’d argue that in a lot of cases, landing the right (competitive) internship can be more valuable (or at least lead to being more valuable) than a high-paying, salaried job&hellip;even if the internship doesn’t pay you a dime in cash.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"480\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ed9a3d56a32f91ba2362a04699102eb/tumblr_inline_nqkiovL3E71spm8pc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"480\"/><\/figure><p>One of the most important parts of keeping an internship valuable, is keeping it competitive.  Quality interns want other quality interns around them.  So we’ve built a process that filters and selects the highest potential people for our team.  And along the way, we ensure that the applicant fits our culture by testing them against each of our 4 core values:<\/p><p><br/><\/p><p><b>Step 1:<\/b> Online written application (tests CV #1: Be Good and CV #2: Be Excellent) - We use Google Forms for this.  You can see our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12bKwjHSPGejEJUiaZI8IYBIOLut08L8-zyxNWbgKcWQ/viewform?embedded=true&amp;formkey=dDNLRTI0MmcyYWtDSDZNNGZOVERfNUE6MQ\" target=\"_blank\">online application here<\/a>.  We use this step to determine the applicant&rsquo;s skills, experience, and why they are applying for the internship.  The most important question in the online application - “Show us something awesome you&rsquo;ve done?”.  It’s easy to talk about what skills you may (or may not) have.  What we really want to see though is what an applicant has already built.<\/p><p><b>Step 2:<\/b> Online video application (tests CV #3: Be a Friend and CV #4: Be You) - We use <a href=\"http://www.wepow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WePow’s online video interview tool<\/a> for this stage.  This step is all about determining culture fit.  We ask questions like, “Tell us about your best friend” and “How weird are you?”.  The online interview challenges the applicant to think on their toes under a time constrained response.  It also saves us a ton of time by not having to schedule interviews - we just send them to the link, they complete the online video interview (or not) and we watch it when it’s most convenient to us.  Beautiful.<\/p><p><b>Step 3:<\/b> In person interview (tests CV #1: Be Good, CV #3: Be A Friend and CV #4: Be You) - For those that make it to an in person interview, we still need to evaluate two things - A. Were they faking it through steps 1 &amp; 2? and B. Can they execute?  There are certain things you can read about an applicant in person that you can’t determine from paper or a video recording.  How is their non-verbal communication?  Are they confident, but not arrogant?  Do they communicate well when put on the spot?  <\/p><p><b>Step 4:<\/b> FIO task (test CV #2: Be Excellent) - FIO stands for ‘Figure It Out’.  This stage of the interview process is all about execution.  If the applicant has proven that they are a good culture fit and has the experience we are looking for, we just need to see that they can execute on the tasks we give them and can they do it independently.  When we give an applicant a FIO task, we assign them a project to complete under a 1-2 week deadline.  They have all the instructions they need and are expected to complete the FIO task without asking any questions of our team.  The FIO task typically lines up with the type of work they would be doing at Awesome Inc.  So, if an applicant wants to join our video production team, then they get assigned a video to create.<br/><\/p><p><b><br/><\/b><\/p><p>Our interns are awesome.  We know that game recognizes game.  Our hiring process is intense and competitive because that is the type of intern that we want to attract.  Our interns go on to do awesome things after Awesome Inc like work at Facebook, Google, The Cartoon Network, or start companies of their own.  Ever since we launched our internship program in 2009, it’s been one of our proudest accomplishments to recruit, select, and retain high-quality talent.<\/p><p>In my follow-up blog post, I’ll talk about how we go about retaining this talent even when they have other high potential, and high paying options on the table.<\/p>"

Nomad Apparel isn&rsquo;t just a fashion company, Gordon said, it’s also a security company. They combine fashion and function that money belts and wireless theft-proof wallets can’t provide. Nomad Apparel’s jeans and khakis come with a zipper pocket that combats pickpocketing, lined with a fabric that combats wireless identity theft. The pockets will fit a cell phone, a wallet and a passport and come in sizes for men and women. The clothing will cost from $50-100 and will be useful for students, business people, teachers and missionaries traveling the world. <\/p><p>Nomad Apparel won the $50 text vote prize, sponsored by <a href=\"https://lexington.score.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SCORE<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"427\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c94e37614734c855918383b918684023/tumblr_inline_nqiv8k8bpF1spm8pc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"427\"/><\/figure><p><i>Kristopher Irizarry- Hoeksema explaining his company Junto3 at 5 Across.<\/i><br/><\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8AzH-Gj7Z0\" target=\"_blank\">Junto3<\/a> is a social media company, working to create tailored applications called community networking apps. They are the parent company of Earyummy and Mixologism, among many others. Their apps work to bring people together through a combination of information, social and real life. Creator Kristopher Irizarry-Hoeksema said that his applications exist to give people a better experience with social media by creating online communities of people with similar interests and helping those people create real life communities as well. One example is their take on political apps, they have created one for conservatives and one for liberals, allowing users to search by congressional district, location and passions.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"427\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/95b0a21f2e3319c89801f05dd835d9df/tumblr_inline_nqiv9cY4Wz1spm8pc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"427\"/><\/figure><p><i>Casey Williams pitching Linkedü last night.<\/i><br/><\/p><p>Casey Williams pitched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNxUQnt4_7c&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Linkedü<\/a>, an online resource and community for teachers. Williams asked the audience to imagine a parking lot after school hours, full of cars because teachers are still working. Linkedü exists to help empty those parking lots, and help teachers keep up with changing information, especially in STEAM fields, through their online community. Their website features paid content from companies, like videos from NASA and LEGO, as well as content that teachers upload, showing people what works and what doesn’t.

The crowd was enthusiastic as they explained that their father said they were too old to get allowance money, so they created this company instead. Bottled Up Messages creates gifts filled with sweet and salty treats, but it’s all about the personalized message attached to the cork. Bottled Up Messages sells to businesses, individuals and works with flower and gift shops. The crowd applauded again when they said that they have currently filled 955 orders and made $6,000 in gross revenue. During the Q&amp;A session after their pitch, Bottled Up Messages explained that they joined the competition to raise awareness and to let people know that just because they&rsquo;re young, that doesn’t mean they can’t run a business.<\/p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"427\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58c84b52fa219fb796e0d81120e9347e/tumblr_inline_nqivawKr7c1spm8pc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"427\"/><\/figure><p><i>mRendering after facing the Hype Squad during 5 Across.<\/i><\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Wt0LKwTuAc&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">mRendering<\/a> was created with the idea that all content should be easily consumed on mobile devices. mRendering works to deliver content to the right people, at the right time, through their app that makes file sharing simple.

For two years <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc U<\/a> has helped anyone and everyone learn to code, from professionals looking to beef up their skill set to middle school students who want to learn the more practical side of minecraft.<\/p><p>John Newton was looking to learn a new skill when he came to Awesome Inc with some C++ coding experience. John recently got a job at<a href=\"https://www.elinkdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> eLink Design<\/a> in Lexington, debugging, upgrading, and creating websites with the skills he learned at Awesome Inc. <\/p><p>“Pretty much everything I was doing [at Awesome Inc U], I’m doing over [at eLink] now. I was hired mostly to work on a big Symfony project,” John said.<\/p><p>One of the bigger parts of this project was debugging the site. John said that his training  from Awesome Inc U gave him the knowledge to know what is going on, so he can fix it without having to google the problem.<\/p><p>“If you get stuck with something, it helps to talk with people,” John said.<\/p><p>John said the most valuable experience he had at Awesome Inc U was creating his own website. Awesome Inc U also became a sounding board for John’s ideas and helped him work through his designs.<\/p><p>Some of the programs John learned at Awesome Inc U were Symfony 2 and Bootstrap, a program that creates website frameworks, which he uses now at eLink Design to help clients. John has created sites for a number of clients, including realty companies, insurance agencies and a cycling team.<\/p><p>John has earned his master’s in astronomy and physics and used to sit at a computer, creating digital images and simulations but came to Awesome Inc wanting to learn how to do something else.<\/p><p>“When you write a piece of code and you go ‘there’s not a single piece of math in this. This is amazing. I didn’t have to implement any piece of weird calculus, I didn’t have to integrate a single thing.’ I think that’s what really drew me into web design, there’s no complicated numerical analysis,” John said. <\/p><p>To the budding web developers of the world, John Newton gives this advice: “Just build. Make your own website, put it up there…. Just keep revamping. Learn the basics and start picking up on frameworks.”<\/p><p>John’s very modest goal for the future is to have a nice business card that says “John Newton, Web designer.” We think John’s future in web development looks way brighter than just a business card, in fact, we think it’s just as bright as the stars he used to work with.<\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p>By: Brian Raney<br/><\/p><p>When people ask me, “What does Awesome Inc do?”, I’ve started to give them an answer that they don’t expect.  Actually, I don’t even answer the question at first.  Instead I answer a different, but more important question, “Why does Awesome Inc exist?”<b><br/><\/b><\/p><p>The truth is, what we do is much less significant than why we exist.  What we do will change over time. Why we do it will remain constant.  People might not be interested in what we do, but everyone can get behind why we do it.  To be honest, a lot of our team isn’t all that interested or motivated by what we do.  Despite that, every single member of our team will make (and has already made) considerable sacrifices for why we do it.<\/p><p>The response people may expect is something like: “Awesome Inc is a co-working space”, “we write software”, “we host events for entrepreneurs”, “we are an incubator for startups”, “we are a coding school”, or a listing of any number of the things that we do. Instead, I say, “Awesome Inc exists to help people pursue their definition of awesome.”<\/p><p>Assisting people in the pursuit of their own goals and dreams is our primary purpose and motivation.  What we do is just a vehicle for us to fulfill this purpose.<\/p><p>We dubbed the month of May “Motivational May”.  The purpose of Motivational May is to encourage people to reflect on their definition of Awesome and then set tangible goals, professionally and personally, that move them closer to their definition of Awesome.<\/p><p><b>At the beginning of the month, we had everyone (who was brave enough) write down their May goals on post-it notes and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pf-8KgAr0WlDSDEiXjzb_g-Zc_stdBq5tmegbi-iBAk/edit#gid=0\" target=\"_blank\">track them in this doc<\/a> each week.  The goals that we set were BHAGs (<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/leigh-buchanan/big-ideas/jim-collins-big-hairy-audacious-goals.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Hairy Audacious Goals<\/a>).  No one was allowed to set a goal that was going to be easy to hit.  It had to be at least a little scary with a chance of failure.<\/b><br/><\/p><p><b><b><\/b><\/b><\/p><b><\/b><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"480\" data-orig-width=\"640\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/abaf787bc61c6c1b747920ed17909b51/tumblr_inline_np2h6z09Cr1spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"480\" data-orig-width=\"640\"/><\/figure><p><b><b>Many of the post-it note goals won’t be achieved this month, but that’s okay.  As long as each individual is working toward their BHAG and tracking progress then they are pursuing their definition of Awesome.

The exact opposite is clearly a marker of the wrong way to go.<\/p><p>2. Heading towards the goal directly (defined as <i>“Have Integrity, Serve Others, &amp; Do The Right Thing”)<\/i> can shed light on how to optimally implement each core value.<\/p><p>Here’s examples of both for each core value:<\/p><p>Be Excellent<\/p><p>1. As explained in THIS POST If you were to be excellent at being a jerk that would be the definition of ‘bad’. Or, if you were less than excellent in the way you served someone, you’re literally robbing them of the value you agreed to offer them.<\/p><p>2. With <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneurhof.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Entrepreneur Hall of Fame<\/a>, in order to step our game up we always ask, <i>“How can we honor these people more?  How can we make them feel more special &amp; appreciated for their accomplishments?”<\/i>  This thought process has been the guide that has kept us on track for 5 years now, and made the events better every year.<\/p><p>Be A Friend<\/p><p>1. Being a mean friend is worse than being an enemy. <\/p><p>2. If you’ve had a bad day &amp; your friend just had something awesome happen to them, should you complain to them or join them in their excitement?  Asking how you could serve them better makes the decision much clearer &amp; you a much better friend.<\/p><p>Be You<\/p><p>1. If “You” were without integrity, always selfish, &amp; did the wrong thing all the time&hellip;that’s called being a villain (and an idiot). <\/p><p>2. If you think of the music you enjoy, the clothes you wear, the interests you have as a way to celebrate the life you’ve been blessed with&hellip;then that’s what the world needs.  And you need to share it as often as possible.<\/p><p>So if you start with Be Good, it can provide both ends of the magnet for every other core value - pushing you directly away from its opposite &amp; pulling you closer towards its ideal.<\/p>"

Fresh approved. <\/p><p>OdoRcept, a service that identifies which odor receptors in the nose are activated by a smell was pitched by Tim McClintock. He aims to use OdoRcept as a way for fragrance and flavor companies to perfect their odors.<\/p><p>Alexander Slabaugh and Ben Patenaude teamed up with their GridU pitch, an app that teaches football players the thinking side of the game. @ALLTheWaffles used GridU’s pitch as the perfect lead in for his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ALLTheWaffles/status/593541605291925505\" target=\"_blank\">Freshest Tweet<\/a>, selected by yours truly.<\/p><p>Last but not least was Michael Lewis and his winning pitch for <a href=\"http://www.financeu.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FinanceU<\/a>, the second of our “U” suffixed companies. FinanceU uses the wonders of crowdfunding to create custom built scholarships for college students.<\/p><p>Our five course night of pitches wouldn’t be complete without the green at the end. People eat vegetables for dessert now, right? Riot Cosmetics won the $50 text vote, which amounts to 6.25 Chipotle burritos, in case you were wondering. FinanceU won the night’s $500 prize and a chance to compete for $5,000 in December, that’s a lot burritos folks. <\/p><p>As always, we look forward to seeing you at the next 5 Across event. The next one will be on May 20 in Ashland. Then after that on June 17 back in Lexington. See you there!<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>My (and Awesome Inc’s) first two core values are #1 Be Good &amp; #2 Be Excellent - in that order.  Obviously, you don’t want someone to be excellent at being a jerk, but this prioritization also sets up excellence in your chosen endeavor as a moral imperative. <\/p><p>“Be Good” means that you should have, in the forefront of your mind, the benefits of others (tangible &amp; intangible) as your primary aim.  When coming up with our core values at Awesome Inc, we wanted one of them to be humility, or things being “not about us”, but we settled on ‘serve others’&hellip;which became ‘Be Good’.  In the context of Awesome Inc, this means that we deeply care about <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">giving people the tools necessary to create with technology<\/a>, making it easier for people to <a href=\"http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">grow scalable ideas<\/a> (read: “businesses”), <a href=\"http://www.5across.org/\" target=\"_blank\">building the startup community in Lexington<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://continuousjoy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">bringing joy to people through acts of service<\/a>.  <\/p><p>In my life as a physician, it means providing each patient with the most accurate diagnosis &amp; up-to-date treatment regimen as well as the maximum amount of empathy &amp; concern for their physical well-being.<\/p><p>So, if we clearly state that these forms of “Being Good” are our first &amp; highest core value, and we’ve chosen of our own free will the version of “serving others” we feel most called to, then to not “Be Excellent” would be committing one of your biggest self-defined sins.  In the above two examples, it would literally mean you were:<\/p><p>Awesome Inc:<\/p><p>- <b>Robbing people<\/b> of the tools necessary to create with technology<\/p><p>- <b>Making it harder for people<\/b> to grow with scalable ideas<\/p><p>- <b>Shrinking<\/b> the startup community in Lexington<\/p><p>- <b>Lessening joy that people experience<\/b> through poorly executed or non-existent acts of service<\/p><p>Physician:<\/p><p>- <b>Less accurate diagnosis<\/b>, outdated or blatantly <b>incorrect treatment<\/b><\/p><p>- <b>Less empathy &amp; concern<\/b> for my patients’ physical well-being<\/p><p>Now, you have to choose wisely, or I should say <i>genuinely<\/i>, because you can’t honestly care about &amp; give yourself to everything.  Every hour volunteered &amp; every dollar donated to one cause is an hour or dollar not given to another.  So if you’ve discovered or decided what you want to give yourself to, it’s okay to let other opportunities to ‘be good’ go.  In fact, you’ll need to that in order to execute on the ones that you do care about.<\/p><p>If you really believe (as we say we do) that “Be Good” is your first &amp; highest core value, then you shouldn’t compromise on its execution&hellip;actually, you <i>cannot<\/i> compromise without violating your primary aim.<\/p><p>That’s why excellence is a moral imperative.<\/p>",

Now, I know that I-75 doesn’t carry the same “wow” factor as the Mississippi River, but this leap over the interstate demonstrates a tremendous opportunity for growth in Kentucky’s entrepreneurial ecosystem.  5 Across Ashland will be hosted by Ignite, an up and coming coworking space on a mission to spread entrepreneurship across Appalachia.  <br/><\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/igniteashland?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">Ignite<\/a> opened its doors in downtown Ashland in May 2014, hoping to give light to a region burdened with the economic hardships of a diminishing coal industry.  Marty Myers, the founder of Ignite, is an Ashland native and entrepreneur who believes Ashland can successfully grow and sustain a vibrant startup community.  <\/p><p>For years, Marty frustratingly watched as recent graduates left his hometown to pursue jobs in larger cities.  The exodus of talent made it clear that the community’s stance on entrepreneurship needed to change.<\/p><p>“A problem in this area is young people grow up and ask, ‘What big company am I going to go work for?’ I want to break that mold a little bit,” said Marty.  “I want them to ask, ‘What kind of company or product can I create to create jobs?’”<\/p><p>Since launching Ignite, Marty has opened a collaborative co-working space in downtown Ashland, partnered with the Kentucky Innovation Network to host the Entrepreneur Pitch Competition, and led a variety of entrepreneurial networking and training meetings.  He is building a community that supports innovative thinking and risk-taking.  The next addition to his pipeline of community events will be 5 Across Ashland.<\/p><p>“5 Across is a great event.  It is high energy, fast paced, and informal, which meshes well with the culture of most startups.  By bringing 5 Across to Ashland, we hope to encourage more entrepreneurs to share their ideas, collaborate, and build new businesses here in Ashland.”<\/p><p>Frogger your way over I-75 to Ashland, Ky. on May 26th at 5pm to celebrate the first ever 5 Across Ashland!

      "regular-body": "<p>by Garrett Ebel (Awesome Inc Director of Daily Activities)<\/p><p>In most situations, we are taught to plan first and act later.  Building a house?  Better start with some blue prints.  Taking a road trip?  It makes sense to select a destination and the roads you’ll take to get there.  However, when you are starting a new business, planning should follow action.<br/><\/p><p>Imagine you are sitting in a dark room.  There is no sound.  There are no windows.  The air is scentless.  Now answer one question, “Is it raining outside?”  <\/p><p>Seems ridiculous, right?  How can you know the weather if you are cooped up in a room with no sound, light, or smell?<\/p><p>Yet, I am too often confronted with a similar absurdity when I talk to hopeful entrepreneurs.  They hand me a business plan with pro forma financial statements, a ten point marketing strategy, and an appendix for endless charts and graphs.  It’s spiral bound and covered in plastic to protect it from coffee stains.  It’s gorgeous.  But I don’t care about this document, unless of course, the company is selling business plans.  <\/p><p>Instead I ask one simple question:<\/p><p>“How many customers have paid you to solve this problem?”<\/p><p>The standard answer:<\/p><p>“Well, none yet, but…(insert excuse followed by inflated statistic that supports the value proposition)!”<\/p><p>ACTION is the only way to prove a business opportunity truly exists.  Without action, a business plan is at best an educated guess and at worst a money pit waiting to swallow you whole, along with any investors naive enough to fund your hypothesis.  Only after you have cash in hand and a line of happy customers high fiving the other, should you begin to plan the next five years of exponential growth for your thriving startup.  <\/p><p><b>Now go take action and start something awesome!<\/b><br/><\/p>"

The second pitch was an app called <a href=\"http://thebarhop.net/\" target=\"_blank\">The Bar Hop<\/a> by Maged Saeed and Alexander Hamilton, which aims to combat college student FOMO (“fear of missing out”) by telling them which bars their friends are going to each night. <\/p><p>Next, Charles Buddeke pitched his donor engagement software, <a href=\"http://donorcentric.co\" target=\"_blank\">DonorCentric<\/a>, a full solution for nonprofit organizations to manage and market to donors on their website and social media.

The paper delivers engaging content for kids and scan codes for hospital information to help parents, among other things.<\/p><p>The final pitch was from brothers Aaron Scales and Jared Scales, who unveiled their plan for a new mural in downtown Lexington, inspired by their years of experience designing international embassies for the government and street art projects with their company, <a href=\"http://www.brocoloco.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BroCoLoco<\/a>.<\/p><p>The first award presented was the audience text vote sponsored by Score, which went to BroCoLoco.

      "regular-title": "An hour with an entrepreneurial genius.",
      "regular-body": "<p>By Brian Raney<\/p><p>Today I spent an hour in the mind of an entrepreneurial genius.  Awesome Inc hosted a mentor session for our <a href=\"http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Fellowship Companies<\/a> led by Jim Host, founder of Host Communications (later sold to IMG).  I left educated and inspired.<b><br/><\/b><\/p><p>Here are my biggest takeaways:<\/p><p>1. <b>Communicate effectively<\/b> - If you’ve ever heard Mr. Host talk, you’ve witnessed a powerful display of storytelling to make a series of points.  Mr. Host uses stories to forge a connection between himself and the listener.  He is one of the best communicators that I’ve ever observed and has a way of using just the right amount of words, not too few, not too many.<br/><\/p><p>2. <b>Do everything with honesty and integrity<\/b> - Mr. Host tells a story about how he used to tell people when they started working for him that he has two rules; 1. Don’t misrepresent yourself or this company&hellip;ever, and 2. Don’t ever steal 5 cents from this company.  If you break either of these rules you are fired on the spot, no second chances.  If he can’t trust you, then he won’t work with you.  If you have a struggle with something else, be it drugs, alcohol, a personal issue, or a learning curve problem, he is always open to helping you fix the problem. He will give you a second chance and even pay for you to seek the help necessary to solve the problem.  Just don’t break his rules about honesty and integrity.<br/><\/p><p>3. <b>Be organized<\/b> - Write down the 5 most important things you need to do each day and do the hardest thing first.  We all struggle with procrastination.  At the same time, we all love checking things off lists.  Mr. Host has been practicing this since he was  young entrepreneur and always completes his list of 5 important things starting with the most difficult thing first.<\/p><p>4. <b>Confidence <\/b>- You have to have faith in yourself if you expect others to have faith in you.  Good entrepreneurs, leaders, and employees believe in themselves and believe they can get the job done.  This leads to opportunities and allows you to bounce back from failures (which are inevitable).  In 1971, Mr. Host ran for Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky.  He decided to avoid all external fundraising and completely self funded his campaign.  He lost the election.  At this point he was over $70,000 in debt and was down to $132 in his bank account.  But he wasn’t going to give up on himself, because he believed in himself.  He bounced back and started Jim Host &amp; Associates (which he often jokes about not having any associates at the time).  Within a year he paid off all of his debt and was on his way to creating a company that would later do over $140 million in annual revenue.  He never lost confidence that he could win.<\/p>"

I just know what has worked for me and what I have learned from the journey, failures, and successes. If I can solve these problems and figure these things out, then each and everyone of you can also solve these problems and figure it out. I come from very humble beginnings, I moved 17 times the first 18 years of my life, I barely graduated high school, I do not have a college education. For me, I have learned that I can educate myself as I go through life and YOU can too!<\/p><p>- DO NOT EVER turn back once you decide to follow your dream and passion. People will tell you that you’re crazy and an idiot. They are right, but press on. To do this thing called a “startup”, you have to be different; you have to go against the grain. You have to want to do things that everyone else on the planet thinks you cannot do.<\/p><p>- NEVER EVER PAY FOR SOMETHING AT FULL PRICE WHEN YOU CAN NEGOTIATE IT FOR FREE, OR CLOSE TO FREE. I put that in bold because unless you have a large influx of cash into your business, you will need to master this art. In order to do this you must find a way to be resourceful. Learn to leverage Google, as it will give you the answer to ANY question you can think of. I had our first two websites built for a total of less than $900. These websites were enough to bring us to the point where we were ready to bring investors on board&hellip;at a valuation I never dreamed of. I connected with a business mentor from Google Ventures campus in Tel Aviv. NEVER spend money on something that is FREE!<\/p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"750\" data-orig-width=\"1140\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GYssX7gf4S7bsked7woplroNj85cIbfmMsnm7oMC06LXZzfIkx-hdodKa6ODhLFj1l77xcruw-UuvNAmJSdG2fKJIExq3HwF1kezMEis_zTo8x9GUqlbFxdykoY5T1JxuQ\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/afdd669a933c451bed322da813709e52/tumblr_inline_pk0mpqJrYA1spm8pc_540.png\" alt=\"CCR website.png\" data-orig-height=\"750\" data-orig-width=\"1140\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GYssX7gf4S7bsked7woplroNj85cIbfmMsnm7oMC06LXZzfIkx-hdodKa6ODhLFj1l77xcruw-UuvNAmJSdG2fKJIExq3HwF1kezMEis_zTo8x9GUqlbFxdykoY5T1JxuQ\"/><\/figure><p>- Learn to sell, learn to sell, learn to sell, and then learn to close the sale! Selling is the foundation of growing a startup. You have to sell yourself on doing something so insane, you have to sell a co-founder on why they should jump off the bridge with you, and most times you have to sell your spouse or significant other to take the journey with you. Then you have to sell someone on using/buying whatever it is you are offering with your startup. Finally, you need to sell investors on why they need to give you their hard-earned money. And that’s when the real selling begins. You have to sell employees on why they should follow you, then sell them on why they should sell to the customer. Selling without a doubt is the basis of growing your dream, so learn it. If you don’t like it then find a co-founder who sells - someone who is fearless and is willing to risk it all, someone who when told NO hears a YES.<\/p>\n<p>- Give back. The one thing I have learned in the last 18 months of educating myself on the startup culture and how to raise funds is that you must give back.<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Here is a list of tools and resources that I have found very useful. Most are free or have a very minimal cost. I never pay for anything unless I feel it can make me 10x return on it.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.getsidekick.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sidekick<\/a> from Hubspot (free)<\/p>\n<p>This allows you to see who and how many times someone opens the emails you sent them.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sumome.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sumome<\/a> (free)<\/p>\n<p>All-in-one box of goodies to help you grow your business.

VIDEO chat every chance you get with people, and not just people international or out-of-state, but people in town too. It allows you to be in-person and see their true emotions and body language. Plus, everyone has it!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I know you are thinking, duh Shane, but seriously if you come across an article that is awesome, look up the writer on FB, add them, and message them. NEVER, EVER be afraid to add anyone you think can help you. Connect with people! You will thank me later on this one.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Connect, connect, connect. Utilize it the same way I explained Facebook. Tip: pay for a month of premium and then cancel it. LinkedIn will contact you two weeks later and offer you a free month. So far they have done this with me for 5 months straight.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://t.signaledue.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XX43LyKq2W1qfXkn3Mx_7sW1p1hXH56dLBrf4thY0002?si=4646345436561408&amp;pi=3C97F947-6B74-4194-AB06-C019BE64F09E&amp;t=http://Angel.co\" target=\"_blank\">Angel.co<\/a><\/p>\n<p>DO NOT PUBLISH YOUR COMPANY PAGE until you are 100% certain you are ready to do so.

At the end of January, a group of volunteers, led by Awesome Inc co-founder Brian Raney and his wife Michelle Raney, as well as Garrett Ebel, will be doing just this. This winter, the <a href=\"http://continuousjoy.org\" target=\"_blank\">Joy Project<\/a> will be helping a family with 4 children, 2 of whom have special needs, build a therapy gym in their home. The children have Sensory Processing Disorder, and often have trouble reacting appropriately to the world around them. Michelle Raney says this gym will benefit the family by providing their children a source of sensory stimuli to help them learn, all in their own home. “We have a special love for children with special needs. As a speech therapist, I see first hand the benefits of carrying over strategies and techniques in the child&rsquo;s home environment. Therapy equipment can become costly, so I proposed the idea of helping a family make a dream a reality by helping them create a sensory space in their own home,” she says.<\/p>\n<p><span>So how can you help with the Joy Project? Volunteers will be “hanging suspended equipment, creating a calming space, building a climbing structure, sewing tunnels and blankets, and more.” If that sounds like something you might want to do, sign up to volunteer <\/span><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/joy-project-build-day-sensory-gym-for-special-needs-family-tickets-15216424736\" target=\"_blank\">on Eventbrite<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/srnYYZF3vBS8gxj8aTk_bhydHnp3FJOe-67pWKC2ElCBGcJku4yU0UzoNzu5A1L6WAAS6hX4HyCJZK42cTbLkSHk6cFBmFF7yFkFC38zpjFaADgFFw7DWzRNY0W_0tL-8g\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"341px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/55f2eb05051432ffa610af65d426782c/tumblr_inline_pk1yqwxIoR1spm8pc_540.png\" width=\"341px;\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/srnYYZF3vBS8gxj8aTk_bhydHnp3FJOe-67pWKC2ElCBGcJku4yU0UzoNzu5A1L6WAAS6hX4HyCJZK42cTbLkSHk6cFBmFF7yFkFC38zpjFaADgFFw7DWzRNY0W_0tL-8g\"/><\/figure><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>One more thing: when you participate in the Joy Project, you aren’t just bringing joy to others, you are bringing true, lasting joy to your own life.

CompleteSet is a web and soon-to-be smartphone application for collectors to archive and hunt for hard-to-find items. It hosts exhaustive lists of items relating to things from Star Wars to sports memorabilia, and has attracted a growing and loyal user base. Here’s founder Gary Darna’s recollection of CompleteSet’s journey from conception to winning 5 Across, and what is in store for CompleteSet in the future:<\/p>\n<p>The first time I pitched CompleteSet was at Startup Weekend Cincinnati in February of 2012. At the time, all I had was an idea. I didn&rsquo;t even have wireframes or a UI designed, so it shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that the pitch didn&rsquo;t go over too well. No one volunteered to join my team, which was my only goal at the event, so I ended up helping someone else turn their idea into a prototype that weekend.<\/p>\n<p>After an exhaustive year-long search and dozens of pitches, I met and recruited my co-founder through <a href=\"http://cob.nku.edu/inkubator.html\" target=\"_blank\">The INKUBATOR program<\/a> at Northern Kentucky University. Since then, Jaime and I have raised $650,000 in an oversubscribed seed round, grown from 2 to 8 employees, and acquired members in more than 30 countries around the world. We&rsquo;ve come a long way since that uninspiring pitch at Startup Weekend, which was three years ago this February.<\/p>\n<p>I shared this story with you because it demonstrates how important events like 5 Across are to the community of entrepreneurs they support. Practice really does make perfect when it comes to pitching. Without the opportunity to pitch in front of an audience of my peers and get honest feedback about my company, I wouldn&rsquo;t have been as prepared to sell our dream to potential investors. As a founder, being able to communicate your vision to investors, your team, and your customers is one of the most important skills you need to be successful. 5 Across prepared me for the tough questions that investors expect to be answered.<\/p>\n<p>Since winning the 2014 5 Across Finals in December, we&rsquo;ve continued to grow at a rapid pace. We plan to use a portion of the prize money to purchase <a href=\"http://www.blinkscan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BlinkScan<\/a>, an innovative device that makes scanning easier than ever. BlinkScan was 1 of the 5 great companies that won 5 Across in 2014. In that way, both of our companies won, and we&rsquo;re excited to support a fellow entrepreneur the way 5 Across has supported us.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"427\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BvwKgdX3nzCD-i7KgXvdR3p_j4hSNFCgZyBmzDaZks_srjDHltkZpftlc9xF3JIjWQoqlS6hvT3X3T1An2FTBKLI13E_GcJ4xruIpiOHAlolcasVhon3JhJrLGE1LhU9Zw\"><img alt=\"CompleteSet.jpg\" height=\"416px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a41cdd258b57488fdf9a339f7c4bbc77/tumblr_inline_pk2w5wJHxY1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"624px;\" data-orig-height=\"427\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BvwKgdX3nzCD-i7KgXvdR3p_j4hSNFCgZyBmzDaZks_srjDHltkZpftlc9xF3JIjWQoqlS6hvT3X3T1An2FTBKLI13E_GcJ4xruIpiOHAlolcasVhon3JhJrLGE1LhU9Zw\"/><\/figure><\/p>"

Produced by Healthy Nation, Vegy Vida is a dip with a bitter-blocking agent to encourage children to eat more vegetables. Here’s what inventor Josh Young had to say about his experience at 5 Across:<\/p>\n<p>The 5 Across competition is full of energy and the team makes a tense situation fun. From the very first introduction Garrett did a wonderful job of making us feel welcome and educating us on both the competition and resources available at Awesome Inc. Additionally, we were paired with incredible mentors like Rick Hahn and Brian Poe that not only assisted with the competition but also provided invaluable advice for our business.<\/p>\n<p>The Vegy Vida Team is very thankful for Awesome Inc and the experience with the 5 Across competition! Both provided support and encouragement that were very helpful for our business. We learned from the teams we competed against and feel very privileged to be a part of the strong entrepreneurial community in Kentucky.<\/p>\n<p>The money we won at 5 Across helped to pay for our new labels so that Vegy Vida can have a strong shelf presence when it launches in 2015!

However, Jacob wasn’t healthy.  He had cut his foot the day before while jumping off a rock into a creek.  It was a pretty deep cut and we all told Jacob  “you don’t need to do this hike today. It’s going to be tough and with only one good foot, we don’t think it’s a good idea.”  But Jacob promptly put aside all doubt,  “I’ll be fine, don’t worry about it guys&hellip;.I’ll just wear sandals”.  For some reason at the time that actually made sense as a solid argument and we accepted it that Jacob wasn’t going to back down.   <\/p>\n<p>The hike started off as a comfortable stroll through the woods, nice clear path.  Half way up the mountain, no problems.  About another quarter mile up though and Jacob’s hurt foot was starting to bother him.  Each step he took required much more work than the rest of us.  His face was turning somewhat pale and we could all tell he was in a lot of pain.  <\/p>\n<p>We took a few breaks and each time we would give Jacob an out to stop here and we’ll meet back up with him on the way down.  But each stop, Jacob persisted.  We got about 90% of the way up the mountain and I remember seeing Jacob turn a corner behind me. Kid looked like Rocky after taking a few too many punches from Apollo Creed.<\/p>\n<p>I remember being pretty nervous about the situation.  And not the normal kind of nervous like you get when you’re about to give a performance or ask a girl out on a date&hellip;but the kind of nervous you get when you feel like you’ve made a series of bad decisions and you’re about to pay for it.  You know, the kind of nervous you get when Jim Host calls you and you see his number on your caller ID before you pick up&hellip;“Oh crap, what I have done this time?”<\/p>\n<p>We urged Jacob, “Just wait here and we’ll be right back.”  After catching his breath, his shirt drenched, and sweat literally dripping from his face.<\/p>\n<p>Jacob responded, “Ok. You guys go on.”  <br/><\/p>\n<p>We rushed ahead and did what was by far the most dangerous part of the hike, climbing over rocks single file, on all fours when necessary, with steep 200 foot drops on both sides.  It was one of the more challenging and risky free climbs I’ve done.  We made it to the top and took some pictures &amp; enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment you get when completing something really difficult.  As we were enjoying the views from the top of the mounting, out of the corner of my eye I saw someone climbing over the summit of the rocks.  <\/p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-98b25bb9-9c21-389c-25c0-a2f4b074fa45\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OXlcJaPNp4RvVkNbLiT4KF3tic_kZY9ot9jlxCqc2z78B1wbYxEM2_Z3NP2o1F2OsnEVWH28OmCOc0iuXxtWieJO47n9t_SCjYx5xWrpMXRB83aT__3ZnEElihC53j9j-g\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"182px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d283052ff04e7c8de7e0b09be10350c4/tumblr_inline_pk085lGwSD1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"242px;\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OXlcJaPNp4RvVkNbLiT4KF3tic_kZY9ot9jlxCqc2z78B1wbYxEM2_Z3NP2o1F2OsnEVWH28OmCOc0iuXxtWieJO47n9t_SCjYx5xWrpMXRB83aT__3ZnEElihC53j9j-g\"/><\/figure><\/span><\/p>\n<p>It was as if the music from the movie Rudy was playing in the background, Jacob stood at the top of the summit and everyone from our group cheered in astonishing amazement at this young man’s persistence&hellip;His remarkable resilience.<\/p>\n<p>Jacob wasn’t going to take no for an answer that day.  He was going to persist against the challenges and the obstacles that were presented to him and reach the top of the mountain with only one good foot.

Thanks to the support and accomplishments of the Hall of Fame entrepreneurs, this wall can serve as inspiration to the rest of the entrepreneurial community.  When it gets tough for those of us that are still in the early stage of our careers we can look at their pictures on the wall of the EHOF and know that each of them faced adversity in their journey to the top of the mountain&hellip;and at one point in time, they were at the same part of their climb, facing the same challenges that we’re facing now.  And it was with remarkable resilience that they made it to the top.<\/p>\n\n<p><span> <\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span> <\/span><\/p>"

In October, John Young pitched this FDA approved, patent-pending, “Febreze for vegetables”. During his pitch, John mentioned there was a big production deal in the works for November, and he anticipates having the product on shelves by spring. We hope Vegy Vida has some exciting new developments, and maybe even brings some dip for judges to try.<\/p>\n<p>So many talented teams. But there can only be one winner. The company with the top rated pitch will walk away with $4,000 to help grow their business, and second place will receive $1,000. Plus, there will be multiple door prizes up for grabs in various crowd contests and all new elements. Sound like fun?

Maybe because it was the first one I had been to. All jokes aside, this year’s event, held at the Mellwood Art &amp; Entertainment Center in Louisville, was definitely worthy of praise. <\/p>\n<p>It kicked off with a cocktail hour. Nearly 250 attendees gathered around the space to mingle and chat. Professors rubbed shoulders with entrepreneurs while past Hall of Fame inductees shared stories with the future inductees. The crowd seemed to want cocktail hours instead of a cocktail hour since the mingling was too good.<\/p>\n<p>After taking their seats, MC Bobby Clark introduced Awesome Inc’s very own Brian Raney to give a speech. Brian stood behind the podium and orated like Abe Lincoln in his prime. His speech about resilience definitely resonated with the number of entrepreneurs and successful people in the crowd. The Emerging Entrepreneurs were introduced shortly after Brian’s speech.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of resiliency, Ankur Gopal, one of the Emerging Entrepreneurs, joked that it only took him five and a half years to be recognized as an Emerging Entrepreneur. Nate Morris and Jennifer Mackin were also introduced as Emerging Entrepreneurs with their ventures in sustainability and consulting, respectively. Hopefully, we’ll see these three names again in the Hall of Fame in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Four entrepreneurial heavyweights were inducted shortly after the Emerging Entrepreneurs delivered their speeches. Every one of these men made positive impacts in their communities.<\/p>\n<p>James Booth was the first of the quartet to be inducted. His story as a young undergraduate working in the coal mines is something that many modern college students would find difficult to emulate. The coal industry was where he got his start. He later moved into nearly every other business in Martin County providing jobs for around 40% of the county.<\/p>\n<p>Junior Bridgeman followed James Booth. As a UK student, I have to admit that it was odd to applaud for a former Louisville basketball player but Mr. Bridgeman’s successes stemmed much further than the basketball court. Kidding aside, Bridgeman’s fruitful endeavors in the restaurant industry made him a surefire inductee in the Hall of Fame. His mix of faith and business savvy pushed him to be the best in his field.<\/p>\n<p>Outback founder, Chris Sullivan, was inducted after Mr. Bridgeman. He reminisced about his fraternity days with his brother, (insert name here). The focus of his speech was on giving back to the men and women working for him. It was definitely something the young entrepreneurs in the building wanted to follow.<\/p>\n<p>John Williams, founder of Computer Services Inc., closed off the event by telling a story of how he started the company. His humility was inspiring especially considering his achievements in the tech industry. As a current accounting student, it was reassuring to see someone with an Accounting degree from the University of Kentucky on the stage.<\/p>\n<p>Every one these entrepreneurs deserved to be recognized not only for their accomplishments but also for their contributions to their community. All entrepreneurs would gain from listening to their stories whether it’s James Booth with Martin County, Junior Bridgeman with his faith, Chris Sullivan’s focus on the people, or John Williams and his humility. The Class of 2014 made this year’s Entrepreneur Hall of Fame one of the best ones yet. And it wasn’t because it was my first time going.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, if you want to see a video recap of the event, it’s currently in the works. I’ll let you know when it’s out. Thanks to everyone who organized this event!<\/p>"

The event originated as a Global Entrepreneurship Week promotion for Awesome Labs in 2009, and consisted of a series of flyers and a <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/awesomelabs.org/gew/\" target=\"_blank\">small webpage<\/a> honoring famous entrepreneurs from Kentucky. The idea came from extending excitement about great figures in other halls of fame to the world of entrepreneurship. “We actually assumed that some Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame already existed. We were pretty surprised to find out that it didn&rsquo;t!” said Nick Such, co-founder of Awesome Inc.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"477\" data-orig-width=\"365\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LNapRAbD02M6J0FKXZ5b-AgxdJfGpnp6bjN0rn8GW2Pp3eWR6SVItECSGB4A_2Vur0QSlmdTKh9YvFhp8NxiHkHaiSDuqT-NX-4HaZaZRUr7VA9u6NXejB8F7j4Ost3jXw\"><img align=\"left\" alt=\"ehof.jpg\" height=\"319px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d61a1454bf1fefa5f0399ad9ef02918/tumblr_inline_pk1s3uOorM1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"244px;\" data-orig-height=\"477\" data-orig-width=\"365\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LNapRAbD02M6J0FKXZ5b-AgxdJfGpnp6bjN0rn8GW2Pp3eWR6SVItECSGB4A_2Vur0QSlmdTKh9YvFhp8NxiHkHaiSDuqT-NX-4HaZaZRUr7VA9u6NXejB8F7j4Ost3jXw\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Before long it became apparent that the idea of a Hall of Fame for Entrepreneurs could grow into a formal event. When the first induction was held, Brian Raney, another founder of Awesome Inc, told the Herald-Leader that not only was there not a Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame, “there aren’t many entrepreneurship halls of fame at all.” He said that they went on to create the Hall of Fame with a goal: “Our mission is to raise awareness of the impact that entrepreneurship has made in the Commonwealth and encourage others to pursue similar ambitious endeavors.”<\/p>\n<p>To make the idea a reality, Awesome Inc organizers brainstormed with the Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation and the Small Business Development Center for qualifying entrepreneurs. The final list of nine entrepreneurs, some of whom were on the original webpage, included business people such as Pearse Lyons of Alltech, John Schnatter of Papa John’s, and recent University of Kentucky President Lee Todd, who started tech firms DataBeam and Projectron. The ceremony also included the recognition of emerging entrepreneurs because, “All of the people who are being inducted into the Hall of Fame were at the same stage as these up-and-coming ones at one point, so we felt like in an effort to encourage more entrepreneurs at that level, it would be great to recognize these five emerging entrepreneurs,” said Raney. 75 people attended this event, and got to hear some awesome things from these famous entrepreneurs. Nick Such said,  “We knew the first induction ceremony was a success when we got to hear the inductees share their stories. First, it was simply incredible to be in one room with Jim Host, Lee Todd, and Davis Marksbury - three of Kentucky&rsquo;s iconic media and technology entrepreneurs. Then we got to listen Warren Rosenthal tell stories about starting Long John Silvers and having a humble meeting with Colonel Sanders in the early days of KFC, which of course happened before John Y. Brown, also present at the ceremony, grew that company into the global brand it is today.”<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>The Class of 2011 had 5 members, including Bill Samuels, Jr. of Maker’s Mark and  David Jones, Sr. of Humana. For the 2012 Hall of Fame, past inductees voted on the three members for that year, bringing the community of entrepreneurs closer together for the event.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Inductees by Year<\/strong><\/p>\n<div>\n<p>2010<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.entrepreneurhof.com/john-y-brown\" target=\"_blank\">John Y Brown<br/><\/a><a href=\"http://www.entrepreneurhof.com/pearse-lyons\" target=\"_blank\">Pearse Lyons<br/><\/a><a href=\"http://www.entrepreneurhof.com/william-young\" target=\"_blank\">William T.

This year’s inductees include Chris Sullivan of Outback Steakhouse, Ulysses Lee “Junior” Bridgeman of Bridgeman Foods Inc, James Booth of Booth Energy Group, and John A.

It’s during that beautiful time when Kentucky football and basketball run together making my weekends full of winning. Speaking of weekends full of winning, Startup Weekend Lexington is this month from November 21 to 23. Startup Weekend brings together a lot of different people with the goal to launch a startup within 54 hours.<\/p>\n<p>If you’ve never been to a Startup Weekend event before, then you’ve just stumbled upon the perfect blog post. If you’re a Startup Weekend veteran, skip to the last paragraph for registration information. It’s sort of like a choose your own adventure blog!<\/p>\n<p>Startup Weekend kicks off on Friday night with open mic pitches to attract potential teammates to your business. Don’t be afraid to pitch something ridiculous. Last year, I channelled my inner <a href=\"http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1770258/thumbs/o-TERRY-CREWS-facebook.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Terry Crews<\/a> and pitched a manly scented laundry detergent. The businesses with the best pitches break off into teams and the work starts there. After countless cups of coffee, your team should have a working prototype or business model to present on demo day Sunday afternoon. Sounds fun right? Most importantly, food will be provided throughout the weekend.<\/p>\n<p>You’ll be getting seven meals and launching a startup all in one weekend. What more can you ask for? Startup Weekend is definitely something you don’t want to miss.

We spiced up the general 5 Across formula by adding minute-to-win-it challenges and a Freshest Tweet contest, curated by yours truly. The winner of the Freshest Tweet got to treat himself to lunch at <a href=\"http://www.dadsfavorites.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dad’s Favorites<\/a> just by typing 140 characters on his phone. Look out for even more exciting additions in upcoming editions. <\/p>\n<p>Something that didn’t change was the quality of the pitches. It featured companies with great potential but only one could come out on top. The Rover, Ockham Applied Sciences, Love Me Bloncho, QICourses, and Healthy Nation competed for the $500 prize. This time, Healthy Nation was written on the Happy Gilmore style check for their product Vegy Vida, pitched by Josh Young.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb5407de897acd9a5a7476831d6b1eb0/tumblr_inline_newcd7vUQW1spm8pc.jpg\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2bf48ed5c2935ab207312760f46043e1/tumblr_inline_pk22tyAqZ61spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb5407de897acd9a5a7476831d6b1eb0/tumblr_inline_newcd7vUQW1spm8pc.jpg\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Vegy Vida is a vegetable dip that masks the bitter tastes in veggies that kids, myself included, dislike so much. Not only does it block the bitterness, but it transforms the flavor into something kids love such as bacon or macaroni and cheese. Think of it like Febreeze for vegetables. Just imagine biting into a piece of broccoli and tasting bacon instead. I never ate vegetables as a kid or even now as an adult but anything bacon flavored is hard to resist.<\/p>\n<p>You can’t forget about Ockham Applied Sciences winning the $50 cash text vote. The regular season of 5 Across has come to a close and now it’s time for the finals. Winners from the past five editions of 2014 5 Across will be coming together on December 10 to compete for their share of $5000 or forty Benjamins (if you like to think about it that way). Be on the lookout for a 5 Across Finals preview coming soon!<\/p>"

The biggest news for developers is that the Software Development Kit (SDK) was released on October 17, and this allows app creators to implement some of the exciting new capabilities that come with the update. Now developers have a chance to show off implementations of what they were shown when the Android L preview was unveiled at Google I/O in June. Here’s a rundown of what’s new and relevant to developers, sourced from the <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Android Developer<\/a> site. <\/p>\n<h3>New UI Guidelines<\/h3>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5tMjq3izQ9UzYpaN1V1LMtbiRL3_LsbGerjO8whi3tG3RXf0YCwt1Spa96BcNZm4wLbW-RMA4dWS9nGeKyDsuy1gmB3rjDt4Txst8Iy7lnTpAoeHgk-8TH92tqNHsbqj3w\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"299px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2db98934924a45a335ffd33bc40fe066/tumblr_inline_pk18s7h6IT1spm8pc_540.gif\" width=\"401px;\" data-orig-height=\"600\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5tMjq3izQ9UzYpaN1V1LMtbiRL3_LsbGerjO8whi3tG3RXf0YCwt1Spa96BcNZm4wLbW-RMA4dWS9nGeKyDsuy1gmB3rjDt4Txst8Iy7lnTpAoeHgk-8TH92tqNHsbqj3w\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>What: Google Material Design - “A design metaphor inspired by paper and ink that provides a reassuring sense of tactility.”<\/p>\n<p>Who it affects: Anyone who wants their Android app to look really cool.<\/p>\n<p>Back at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/events/io\" target=\"_blank\">Google I/O<\/a> this summer, a new set of design guidelines, dubbed <a href=\"http://www.google.com/design/\" target=\"_blank\">Material Design<\/a>, was introduced. These standards will dictate the look and feel of Android and Google-produced applications, and Android 5.0 introduces some new elements to encourage developers to make their apps consistent with the vision.<\/p>\n<p><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"476\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ti5-ieeGzbtjtSEUHKXwWR3o_sBsoulf-JFB0wuTaOajaW_TsmMiPGf6_cKyMWnQeeZaqWhbNIgI-66azhl8oLxh2K5yIW_FEIhJFk-dDCz-_eqvX6imu1nqvRER7U65Ww\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"297px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/280688f16197580a1f34f46fabee520c/tumblr_inline_pk18s8nDw51spm8pc_540.png\" width=\"308px;\" data-orig-height=\"476\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ti5-ieeGzbtjtSEUHKXwWR3o_sBsoulf-JFB0wuTaOajaW_TsmMiPGf6_cKyMWnQeeZaqWhbNIgI-66azhl8oLxh2K5yIW_FEIhJFk-dDCz-_eqvX6imu1nqvRER7U65Ww\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>The main elements for material design-consistent apps that are new include <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/material/theme.html\" target=\"_blank\">a new app theme<\/a>, new widget implementations, and new APIs for animations throughout the app.<\/p>\n<h3>New Runtime Environment<\/h3>\n<p>What: Android Runtime (ART)<\/p>\n<p>Who it affects: Developers who care about what goes on behind-the-scenes<\/p>\n<p>On the backend of things, Lollipop has introduced a new runtime environment called ART. Originally an experiment on the previous release, KitKat, ART doesn’t need existing apps to change to experience the benefits. ART provides what is called  “ahead-of-time” compilation, which allows apps to run faster and more efficiently. This mean an app is compiled all at once at the start instead of on-the-fly as in the <a href=\"https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/\" target=\"_blank\">current Dalvik model,<\/a> which should cause considerable speed increase. Some other benefits are more debugging tools and better crash reports for developers.<\/p>\n<h3>New Notifications<\/h3>\n<p>What: Lock screen visibility for notifications<\/p>\n<p>Who it affects: Developers of apps with notifications<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>In addition to inheriting the smooth Material Design animations, notifications are getting some special upgrades in Android Lollipop. Notifications are now visible front and center on the lock screen rather than just in the notification pane. Because of this, apps now have the option to create visibility options for their notifications. Instead than the default notification, apps can choose to show a message on the notification rather than its content when the phone is locked, or keep their notifications from appearing on the lockscreen at all.<\/p>\n<h3>New resource manager<\/h3>\n<p>What: New ways for apps to save battery<\/p>\n<p>Who it affects: Developers who care about conserving resources (hopefully everyone)<\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest things in Android 5.0 is a push for improving battery life, and this includes providing tools for helping apps use less battery. Codenamed <a href=\"https://www.google.com/events/io/io14videos/64bf2234-4bcb-e311-b297-00155d5066d7\" target=\"_blank\">Project Volta<\/a>, the initiative adds new APIs that allow apps to do cool things like schedule processes to run at time when the phone is plugged in, or on Wi-Fi instead of cellular. These tools work too; <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/07/examining-project-volta-we-put-android-l-through-our-battery-test/\" target=\"_blank\">Ars Technica reports<\/a> that these tactics can cause a 36% increase in battery life on a Nexus 5.<\/p>\n<h1>The new Nexus lineup<\/h1>\n<p>           To show off what this new software can do, Google has updated its first-party phone line, Nexus. The Nexus line is mainly a reference device with tight integration and optimization of the new software, usually sold through Google, but now available through major cell carriers. The first new device announced was the Nexus 6, a massive phone with a 5.96 inch 1440p display. It boasts a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 805, Adreno 420 graphics, and 3 GB RAM. Mostly a souped up 2nd gen Moto X, it also has a 13 MP rear camera with optical image stabilization, 4K video, and dual-front facing speakers. If there’s any device that makes Lollipop look like a champ, this is it. <\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"863\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zD8RNqFjJfHklC55lAIIUPwK6uFTZfsOHJsTRqqvrIKXrriZcHvBFw_6niMo0x61zrvbQ5C3dZGPwTeFOxV9TBp6ODl_ZcipcJBqQw3_0nxdJnILuu7dERMD4zxaWrcm_w\"><img alt=\"Nexus 6 phones with Monument Valley screenshot\" height=\"336px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0363a58234eb470c2cbb0774e623b483/tumblr_inline_pk18s9jzG91spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"624px;\" data-orig-height=\"863\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zD8RNqFjJfHklC55lAIIUPwK6uFTZfsOHJsTRqqvrIKXrriZcHvBFw_6niMo0x61zrvbQ5C3dZGPwTeFOxV9TBp6ODl_ZcipcJBqQw3_0nxdJnILuu7dERMD4zxaWrcm_w\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>            For the tablet side of things, the Nexus 9 was introduced, with a 8.9 inch IPS LCD display, an Nvidia Tegra K1 processor and Kepler GPU. It too will have dual front-facing speakers, and will be a prime showcase for Android Lollipop.  <\/p>\n<p>            The most intriguing new addition is the Nexus Player, a media streaming box like Android TV. It features a voice activated remote, an optional game controller and Google Play centric-home screen. It features Chromecast capability and can mirror select iOS devices, Android devices, pages in Chrome on any computer,  and Chromebooks. The player looks to replace the game console, with free online multiplayer in Google Play, and synchronization with the companion phone app. <\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"439\" data-orig-width=\"1068\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P8CrbbYCTC_aBuR3o8Sa6-CivgKmaYkHfqn5C_S_FKDif5_vFV9WUC5DzRfFdgtDWLyx_ZiahLi5QZED-MFk8tzl_DuK9GVZx8Dz3M446FxlKX9zrLKGb8mOosoPQtfrLA\"><img alt=\"Player console, remote and gamepad\" height=\"256px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be178a60eabd0822f160946770327d98/tumblr_inline_pk18s9drrr1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"624px;\" data-orig-height=\"439\" data-orig-width=\"1068\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P8CrbbYCTC_aBuR3o8Sa6-CivgKmaYkHfqn5C_S_FKDif5_vFV9WUC5DzRfFdgtDWLyx_ZiahLi5QZED-MFk8tzl_DuK9GVZx8Dz3M446FxlKX9zrLKGb8mOosoPQtfrLA\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>           Google is really stepping up its game this time around, with important updates for developers and users alike. Material design gives Android the visual update it needs, and ART gives it the performance it needs to stay relevant in today’s discerning market. The new Nexus line will really be able to show off what the new Android can do.

Or rather, say hello again to Mac. Mac Glidewell has been a familiar face around Awesome Inc for quite a while and we’re all ecstatic that he is back and helping out at the space again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Glidewell was first introduced to Awesome Inc through his business endeavor Tagapet, a scannable pet tag that sends GPS information to the pet’s owner when scanned, as well as linking the scanner to a pet profile complete with name and picture. Tagapet caught Awesome Inc’s attention by winning the Elevator Pitch contest while Mac and business partner Michael were students at the University of Kentucky; soon after, Tagapet became a part of Awesome Inc’s second accelerator in 2012.<\/p>\n<p>During Glidewell’s time with Awesome Inc, Tagapet was accepted into an international business accelerator in Amsterdam, and the team relocated to the Netherlands for three months. Unfortunately, their attempt to launch a new version of Tagapet with a real time tracker didn’t go as well as was hoped, and eventually the team came home in February 2014.<\/p>\n<p>Even though the new tag didn’t take off as planned, returning to the states was far from a failure. Glidewell moved back to Lexington to attend the UK and reconnected with the Awesome Inc family. He can now be found at the space helping out as the Head of Mentor Relations. He’ll be working with <span>Awesome Inc<\/span>’s fellowship teams, providing advice from his past entrepreneurial experience, leading communications sessions on learning customer language and connecting with mentors, as well as bringing more mentors to the program and sending out a monthly newsletter.<\/p>\n<p>Mac is excited to be back with Awesome Inc, saying that he really supports <span>Awesome Inc<\/span> and the community formed around our mission. The Fellowship is lucky to have his entrepreneurial background and positive attitude back on board and can’t wait to see all the awesome he’s going to bring to Team Alpha!<\/p>\n<p>By Sarah Hoffmann<\/p>"

      "regular-title": "Kids these days are so . . .",
      "regular-body": "<p>SMART.  I’ve heard numerous quotes from adults about how kids these days are so lazy, entitled, irresponsible.  “The future seems bleak,” we’ll say to one another when we hear about a trouble maker kid that refuses to work hard at school or the student athlete that thinks they don’t have to earn the starting position on the sports team.  I’ve murmured these quotes more times than I can remember.  <\/p>\n<p>But this summer, I found myself murmuring something else.  I had the pleasure of working closely with over fifty middle and high school students through our <a href=\"http://blog.awesomeinc.org/post/97086960346/teaching-kids-to-code-with-awesome-inc-u\" target=\"_blank\">Kids Code Camps<\/a> at Awesome Inc.  These kids restored my faith in this next generation.  They were smart, hard working, and motivated.  They couldn’t get enough of the computer programming knowledge that our staff was offering them.  <\/p>\n<p>“Now that we’re done with this game, can we go back to coding?” said one 9-year-old student after finishing a game of ping pong during one of the mid day breaks.  <\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"427\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pdafAKpfOcp9u9dchxQfzyz6p4bTrwlTkDk_lhrKZbdg31Vv8PgR6qMYoHyWtrlt1e3gSTQUGr0dtdqbhwe6LYHGAC_eRl5N8tOT81a5GbE2FwPVm-cuOM9PusfYe5L95g\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"337px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a92f4afe1ea6c6b3179c4e8367cc0f6/tumblr_inline_pkbd6kGYLq1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"506px;\" data-orig-height=\"427\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/pdafAKpfOcp9u9dchxQfzyz6p4bTrwlTkDk_lhrKZbdg31Vv8PgR6qMYoHyWtrlt1e3gSTQUGr0dtdqbhwe6LYHGAC_eRl5N8tOT81a5GbE2FwPVm-cuOM9PusfYe5L95g\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>These kids were eager to learn how to program apps, video games, and web sites.  It was a breath of fresh air.<\/p>\n<p>And, fortunately for these kids, there&rsquo;s never been a better match between an increasingly popular interest and the skills the workforce needs today!  According to the nonprofit Code.org, there are currently more than 150,000 computing jobs available in America.  That number is expected to be 1,000,000 by 2020.  In Kentucky, there are over 3,500 reported open jobs in computing.  Computing jobs have an average starting salary of $60-80K.<\/p>\n<p>The opportunities get even more interesting if you’re considering using these skills to make &amp; sell your own software instead of someone else&rsquo;s.  Facebook, a company started one decade ago, is worth over $200 billion, while Ford Motor, a leading automobile company that was started over a century ago, is worth about $50 billion.  Not bad, Henry Ford, but that means Mark Zuckerberg has created value forty times faster than you (it’s also not a bad place to work - according to a former Awesome Inc team member that now works at Facebook).<\/p>\n<p>I’ve been inspired watching these kids learn computer science principles and build applications of their own.  In 10-20 years, these kids will be building the software that runs our cars, houses, and healthcare systems. So, if you know a kid who might enjoy a future in software development, how do you help him or her get started?<\/p>\n<p>There are a variety of great learn-to-code opportunities that have shown up on the scene over the past few years. The best place to start is with the Hour of Code from <a href=\"http://code.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Code.org<\/a>. Over 10 million people got their introduction to coding during this event, which launched last December. Many students get exposed to the Hour of Code in their schools, but the free resources organized by Code.org can be accessed at home on any computer with a web browser. A great next step is the self-guided curriculum from <a href=\"http://Codecademy.com\" target=\"_blank\">Codecademy.com<\/a>. This site offers a smooth introduction to a variety of popular programming languages like JavaScript and Ruby. From there, taking in-person courses is a solid option. While only 10% of K-12 schools offer computer courses, there are a variety of other offerings. There are some free options like <a href=\"https://coderdojo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CoderDojo<\/a>, as well as paid summer programs like <a href=\"http://www.idtech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">iD Tech Camps<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/curriculum/#k12-day\" target=\"_blank\">One Day Crash Courses<\/a> and semester-long programs like our <a href=\"http://awesomeincu.com\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc Academy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Kids these days are so smart.  Let’s treat them that way and give them the opportunities they deserve.<\/p>\n<p>By Brian Raney<\/p>\n<p>Co-Founder, Awesome Inc<\/p>"

One of the games inside this locally built video arcade machine is Astronaut Kitty Boom Boom created by hometown game developer <a href=\"http://supersoul.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Soul<\/a>. It’s a hectic two-player game that involves launching your cat into space further than your opponent. Trust me, it’s even crazier in person. If Super Soul sounds familiar to you, it’s probably because they just won the August edition of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aSkoxQx2uc&amp;list=UUvPtPw9SRvpxcEQ0JokANsw\" target=\"_blank\">5 Across<\/a>. I recently had the opportunity to visit Super Soul’s headquarters to meet Richie Hoagland and John Meister, the founders of Super Soul.<\/p>\n<p><figure data-orig-height=\"183\" data-orig-width=\"275\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/01d9a2f44b78a35072f52c3505537d73/tumblr_inline_ne4wtljcxn1spm8pc.jpg\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/01d9a2f44b78a35072f52c3505537d73/tumblr_inline_pkb7kqOceW1spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"183\" data-orig-width=\"275\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/01d9a2f44b78a35072f52c3505537d73/tumblr_inline_ne4wtljcxn1spm8pc.jpg\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n\n<p>I was greeted by John as I walked up the steps to their building and was led into the studio, where the magic happens. Their studio is nestled inside a former soul music radio station complete with equipment and records from the previous tenants. Computer monitors and the PlayStation dev kit were a stark contrast to the old school artwork on the walls. <\/p>\n<p>Inside, they were working on their newest game “Speakeasy”, a fighting game featuring prominent Prohibition Era men and women duking it out in a 1920s style environment. I tried my hand in a couple matches of the game. I was matched up against Shea, a Super Soul developer, who had already played hundreds of rounds for bug testing. Somehow, I snuck in a couple wins even as the underdog. <\/p>\n<p>Super Soul’s knack for creating memorable gaming experiences will help them in the future. In their 5 Across pitch last month, John said they would “build an amusement park at CentrePointe” if Super Soul turns super successful. These big ambitions are exactly what drives Super Soul into becoming another mainstay in Lexington’s burgeoning gaming industry. Look for Super Soul at December’s <a href=\"http://5across.org\" target=\"_blank\">5 Across Championship<\/a>, competing with fellow promising companies.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>This month, Awesome Inc U launches the first semester of our <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/curriculum/#academy\" target=\"_blank\">Academy Program<\/a>, with ten students aged nine through sixteen.  The Academy meets in the evening twice a week, from September through December.  It offers advanced instruction for middle and high school students who want to not only improve their coding skills, but also use their skills to develop software products for the real world.<\/p>\n<p>The Academy uses a blended model of instruction and project work, so that once the students learn basic concepts, they can take the initiative on projects that appeal to them.  Over the course of the season, students will work on several small projects to help them master various important coding skills and disciplines.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"427\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lZ0qHAGa2AtzRAmZC0asEMQZyYgviIBhFa5juspqeH-BcW6lnUFf06tVu39LbzWSvWLhK1EASws8lhUBfunJ1eMFQ2jFCNMmzIf3-529p3bxA32rNsxbqO0fEAseAcC3PQ\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"416px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f6d66383b3f942a96a8676639092f18/tumblr_inline_pk1ho5fu3h1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"624px;\" data-orig-height=\"427\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lZ0qHAGa2AtzRAmZC0asEMQZyYgviIBhFa5juspqeH-BcW6lnUFf06tVu39LbzWSvWLhK1EASws8lhUBfunJ1eMFQ2jFCNMmzIf3-529p3bxA32rNsxbqO0fEAseAcC3PQ\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Students get plenty of one-on-one time with Academy instructors and TA’s.<\/p>\n<p>One of the Academy’s strengths is that the instruction is not just high-quality, it is also very personalized.  The small class size of the Academy will allow students to have plenty of one-on-one time with the instructors.  In addition to the lead instructor, there will always be teaching assistants in attendance to assist students with any questions they may have.<\/p>\n<p>Students will also work on one large project throughout the semester.  This project will be the “capstone” of the course, and each student will be able to create a project that appeals to his or her own interests.  Whether a game in Unity, a beautiful website, a cool mobile app, or something else entirely, the students will end the season with a completed project that shows off their creativity and coding skills.<\/p>\n<p>Learning computer science concepts and programming principles aren’t the only things students will get to do at the Academy, though.  They’ll also be able to meet with professional programmers from local technology companies to learn more about the working life of a programmer. Our vision for Awesome Inc U is to build a nationally-competitive software development workforce here in Kentucky. This won’t happen overnight, so foundational initiatives like the Academy are important steps toward realizing that goal over the next ten to twenty years.<\/p>\n<p>By: Ben Jacoby<\/p>",

These students are spending a month at the University of Kentucky and the focus of their studies is on entrepreneurship. Working with the <a href=\"http://gatton.uky.edu/vace/\" target=\"_blank\">Von Allmen Center at UK<\/a>, we have been leading the Fulbrighters through a four-week, hands-on journey into startupland, and we’re pretty excited to hear their teams pitch on Wednesday. Through programs like <a href=\"http://www.5across.org/\" target=\"_blank\">5 Across<\/a>, the <a href=\"https://ci.uky.edu/inet/page/uk-venture-challenge-rules-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">UK iNET Venture Challenge<\/a>, <a href=\"http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Fellowship<\/a>, and starting our own series of companies, our team at Awesome Inc has been part of the idea-to-reality process with over 100 startups. If you’ve participated in a <a href=\"http://lexington.startupweekend.org\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Weekend<\/a> before, then you’ve probably been through a similar process. But for the rest of you with a lingering idea or some vague desire to start your own company, I want to share our process for the early days of becoming an entrepreneur.<\/p>\n<h2>Idea<\/h2>\n<p>While you may think that you have the one great idea for your startup, I’d disagree. What you have is one potential idea that is part of a set of many possible solutions for a given opportunity. Let’s say the problem you want to solve is a basic one: people who work in offices near yours get hungry around lunchtime. One solution that may quickly strike you is to open a restaurant nearby. Great idea! While this is indeed an appropriate solution, you may be overlooking a more viable solution. Perhaps it’s a hassle for nearby workers to leave their office buildings to go to a restaurant, so a delivery service or caterer would be more effective. It’s important to avoid falling in love with your initial idea because it’s likely to change.<\/p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/edit?id=1YnfnIC6WXU2dOOaroFULjlm-IK4X2C0Ev6A_VaAJSxg\" target=\"_blank\">brainstorming phase<\/a>, it’s important to first clearly identify the problem, then to generate a variety of possible solutions. When coming up with these solutions, here are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming\" target=\"_blank\">four brainstorming tactics<\/a>: focus on quantity, withhold criticism, welcome unusual ideas, and combine and improve ideas. That’s right, brainstorming is not about finding the best solution right away. It’s about admitting that sitting in a room alone with your team is not a sufficient way to identify the best solution. Instead, you want to create a list of many possible solutions, one of which may lead you to your best solution. You will then test these ideas in later phases of the startup process.<\/p>\n<h2>Planning<\/h2>\n<p>Our team at Awesome Inc includes some vocal critics of written Business Plans. These static documents are what <a href=\"http://steveblank.com/2012/02/16/who-dares-wins-the-2nd-annual-international-business-model-competition/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Blank calls<\/a> acts of “creative writing.” However, we are huge fans of the process of business planning. When doing this, there are a few tools we use. The first is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas\" target=\"_blank\">Business Model Canvas<\/a>. Sometimes categorized as a one-page business plan, the Canvas is a diagram that helps businesses quickly and visually understand a few key components of their business. The emphasis with the Canvas is on simplicity, iteration, and pivot points. I find that one of the most effective ways to use the Canvas is diagramming the business models of your competitors. What are they good at? Where do they struggle, leaving you with an opportunity to innovate and compete?<\/p>\n<p>It’s also hard to argue with the value of a <a href=\"http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2012/03/financial-planning-for-saas-startups.html\" target=\"_blank\">classic financial planning spreadsheet<\/a>. In order to have a business that survives, you somehow have to earn more than you spend. One way to whittle down your list of brainstormed ideas is to remove ideas that will never make (enough) money to survive. While financial projections, like all attempts at predicting the future, are estimates at best, it’s important to weed out any ideas that don’t look as exciting in a spreadsheet as they sounded in your head.<\/p>\n<h2>Prototyping<\/h2>\n<p>Once you’ve identified a viable idea, it’s time to build it. But don’t you rush off and drop $10k on cutting injection molds just yet! We’re in the prototype phase, which means you want to quickly build a minimally expensive, minimally feature-laden version of your product. You will throw away this prototype when you’re done, but you’ll get to keep the learning that it brings you. The prototype is valuable because it allows your customers to experience your product. More importantly, it allows your team to observe your customers while they experience your product. Do they hold it the way you expected them to? What pieces do they think are missing? What features do they ignore?<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes called a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product\" target=\"_blank\">Minimum Viable Product<\/a> (MVP), prototypes can vary widely from your intended final product. The <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27532820/original_screencast.html\" target=\"_blank\">prototype for Dropbox’s<\/a> cloud storage service was a video showing founder Drew Houston synchronizing files across multiple computers and devices. There are disputes as to whether the Dropbox service he demonstrated was fully functional at the time, but that’s irrelevant. Dropbox’s eventual customers were able to experience the product through that video, so it was a viable prototype. And as a result of watching the video, they handed over e-mail addresses in droves to be part of Dropbox’s early beta release. Which brings us to our next step&hellip;<\/p>\n<h2>Validating<\/h2>\n<p>In the end, the only reason that a business will fail is that its founders decide to give up. Just prior to that end, however, the common struggle that leads those founders to close shop is lack of customers. In the brainstorming phase, you should have what we call “uninformed optimism”. All your ideas look golden and wonderful when they are but crisp words on a page. The planning process, with a Business Model Canvas and spreadsheet, will help remove the obvious non-starters. But what for the rest, the ideas that look like they might work? The only way to find out is to ask the people who hold the power to decide to give you their money: your customers.<\/p>\n<p>The process of Customer Development begins with <a href=\"http://steveblank.com/2014/06/28/customer-discovery-the-search-for-productmarket-fit-2-minutes-to-see-why/\" target=\"_blank\">Customer Discovery<\/a>. Who are your potential customers? You may think you know who they are, but do you truly understand their problem? The importance of this understanding, this empathy, is often underestimated by entrepreneurs. Until you’re certain of what your customers want, you’ll waste time and money trying to build the wrong product. At this point you should form a hypothesis, an educated guess as to how your customers will react to your product. Your mission now is to prove your hypothesis wrong. This may sound counterintuitive, but in a business (as in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method\" target=\"_blank\">scientific experiment<\/a>), you’re in this for the long run, so you’re seeking a verifiable truth. So if, in spite of your best attempts, you can’t prove your hypothesis wrong, then perhaps you’ve found a viable business opportunity. It’s important to not lie to yourself at this stage. People will fill out surveys telling you that they love your product. Your mom will always be a big fan of things you create. But when your customers actually transact something with you, be that spending money for a pre-order, or even submitting email address to join your mailing list, then you have some real evidence of customer demand.<\/p>\n<p>- - -<\/p>\n<p>The process we describe here is an iterative approach, cycling through these four steps until you get closer to building a product that truly meets your customers needs, at a price they’re willing to pay, provided at a cost at which you can afford to keep running your business. While we favor this process, there are certainly <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html\" target=\"_blank\">variations<\/a> that work just as well. In particular, many entrepreneurs start from different places, having done some Ideation and Customer Discovery as a seamless part of prior life experiences or occupations. Whatever process you select, I recommend that a) you have some process, and b) you heed these <a href=\"http://steveblank.com/2010/04/08/no-plan-survives-first-contact-with-customers-%E2%80%93-business-plans-versus-business-models/\" target=\"_blank\">words of wisdom from Steve Blank<\/a>: “No plan survives first contact with customers.” Finally, remember that this idea stage is about 1% of your total startup journey, the rest is execution. Happy startuping!<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><em>Lessons from Dr. Zurbuchen<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In early September I had the pleasure of hearing from an entrepreneurial leader from Ann Arbor, MI.  <a href=\"http://innovateblue.umich.edu/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Zurbuchen<\/a> is the Senior Counselor for <a href=\"http://innovateblue.umich.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Entrepreneurship at University of Michigan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With his team and partners, he has built an incredible entrepreneurship ecosystem at UM.  Here are my top four takeaways from his talk that can be implemented / mirrored for us here at UK:<\/p>\n<ol><li>\n<p>Engage more students - there are so many ideas on UK’s campus from our most valuable resource, our students.  Get them involved in the entrepreneurial community, even if it is just on the surface at first.  The highest potential ones will seek out more deeply rooted engagement.  Zurbuchen told a story of how he paid a small group of students $5 for every idea they could find on campus and set a goal of finding 1,000 ideas to participate in a contest.  It took the students a while to reach the goal, but they eventually made it.  “It was the hardest $5,000 the students will ever earn,” says Zurbuchen.  This resulted in an annual pitch-competition, <a href=\"http://1000pitches.com/\" target=\"_blank\">1000 pitches<\/a>.  I’m thinking about doing something similar at UK.  <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Engage more of the community - Zurbuchen said that the majority of the contributors to the programs at UM are from outside the university.  This includes local entrepreneurs, business owners, investors, service providers.  Brad Feld discusses this component of building a successful entrepreneurial community in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem-ebook/dp/B008UV826U\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Communities<\/a> as one of the four parts of the <a href=\"http://www.feld.com/archives/tag/boulder-thesis\" target=\"_blank\">Boulder Thesis<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Create scalable solutions - just like anything, you have to start small.  But it’s important to focus on ideas that can scale to something very big.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The metric that matters for the university entrepreneurial program at UM is “shots on goal”.  This is interpreted as opportunities that are being pursued, both by entrepreneurs (students &amp; faculty), as well as projects that might help the startup community.  For example, a new startup that 2 students in their dorm room are working on counts as a shot on goal.  So does a new entrepreneurial initiative such as a pitch contest that is being organized.  Make that metric go up and the program is succeeding.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>Overall, lots to learn from Zurbuchen and everything that he has accomplished at UM.  <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bx_Q0BT9EMjONFNxQ2tIbWdsOUhwVk4wUHcxRTRhdXFtUUo4/edit\" target=\"_blank\">Here is a copy of his pitch deck<\/a> with additional info and tips.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Jamie Leddin for convincing Dr. Zurbuchen to visit us in Lexington!<\/p>\n<p><span>By: Brian Raney<\/span><\/p>"

In the 4 days of the Week of Code Camp, students learned to program a website, a mobile app, and a video game.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/63795c2268a162edc76797c8554b8668/tumblr_inline_nbnmtxiDDP1spm8pc.jpg\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9f0384580bbdfb40a13efdca4c625575/tumblr_inline_pk22vaq10k1spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/63795c2268a162edc76797c8554b8668/tumblr_inline_nbnmtxiDDP1spm8pc.jpg\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n\n<p>On day one, the students learned how to make their own websites from scratch in HTML and CSS.  They learned how to select colors with hex values and create a table using only HTML tags.  Then they got a chance to use FTP to upload their files directly to the server that hosted their websites.<\/p>\n<p>On the second day, they used MIT’s App Inventor to create an Android app that could turn text into speech.  They started by hard-coding their phrases into the app.  Then, they figured out how to receive text input typed by the app’s user.  After they mastered the text-to-speech app, they spent the afternoon creating a Whack-a-Mole app which could be played by clicking on the moles as they appeared.<\/p>\n<p>On day three, the students used the <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/tutorials/unity-pong/\" target=\"_blank\">Unity Game Engine<\/a> to create their own complete replica of Pong.  They each had a 2-player game with working paddles, a ball that bounced off the paddles and walls, and a system to keep score and reset the game when one player won.  <\/p>\n<p>On the final day, each of the kids worked on a project of his/her choosing which they presented to an audience of parents and Awesome Inc staffers at the end of the day.  Some of them chose to make websites, some made apps, while some made different and more complex games in Unity. At the end of the day, every one of them had an impressive final product to show off.  In three hours.  It was awesome.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/57492673aa53f08e306b183f3acdbb16/tumblr_inline_nbnmwq0O9e1spm8pc.jpg\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff309ae10b4e11dc072e0a9fb7739c87/tumblr_inline_pk22vbAsd01spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/57492673aa53f08e306b183f3acdbb16/tumblr_inline_nbnmwq0O9e1spm8pc.jpg\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n\n<p>If you think this sounds like something that someone you know might be interested, we’re launching another Kids Coding Camp this fall - October 2nd - 5th.  <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/awesome-inc-kids-code-camp-tickets-12989777775\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up by September 20th to save $200.<\/a>  We expect this camp to sell out!  <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/awesome-inc-kids-code-camp-tickets-12989777775\" target=\"_blank\">Here is the registration page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, a single week is only enough to skim the surface of the world of coding.  That’s why, this fall, Awesome Inc is kicking off the first semester of the <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/curriculum/#academy\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc Academy<\/a>.   <\/p>\n<p>Starting in September and ending in December, the Academy will give student an in-depth look at coding topics.  They’ll work on projects throughout the semester, get an introduction to the theory behind programming, and get one-on-one time with the instructors.  They’ll even have an opportunity to meet industry professionals and learn more about what it’s like to be a professional developer.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you don’t have to take it from us that starting early is great for a programmer’s career.  Bill Gates had his first experience with computers when he made a tic-tac-toe game at the age of 13.  Mark Zuckerberg was creating video games in middle school.  Larry Page, co-founder of Google, had two programmers for parents and was surrounded by computers and technology throughout his childhood.  <\/p>\n<p><span>There are many other programmers whose life story shows that it’s never too early to start learning to code.  The students at our Code Camp events have been the most creative, attentive, and enthusiastic learners we could have hoped for and they’re off to a great start mastering an invaluable set of skills.  Hopefully, they’ll keep on learning, and in a decade or two they’ll be the professionals we invite back to help inspire the next generation of young programmers!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>By: Ben Jacoby<\/span><\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><em>Why incremental progress takes us further than giant leaps<\/em><\/p>\n<p>I used to think that significant things in life were done in large chunks as sheer acts of will. Study cram sessions, Spring Cleaning, hackathons. But a single step doesn’t finish the marathon, nor does a single battle win the war. I’m now a fan of small, but consistent, progress.<\/p>\n<p>So much of our progress in life comes from setting and achieving goals. <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-blog-of-james-clear/if-you-completely-ignored-your-goals-and-focused-on-this-one-thing-would-you-get-better-results-1451c43c0c64\" target=\"_blank\">James Clear suggests<\/a> that if we truly want to achieve, we should focus less on the goals and more on our process. When we talk about the Tortoise and the Hare, I think we often overlook a key concept. While the Hare moves quickly, the Tortoise, “slow and steady”, wins the race. I’ve always fixated on the quick versus slow dichotomy, what I’ve overlooked is the word <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">steady<\/em>. Steady means consistent progress. Sure, it’s incremental, but it’s linear. It’s predictable.<\/p>\n<p class=\"graf--p\"><a id=\"0327\"><\/a>Stanford professor <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-profound-life-lessons-from-Stanford-Professor-John-Ousterhout/answer/Eric-Conner?utm_content=bufferc372a&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\" target=\"_blank\">John Ousterhout is credited<\/a> with the advice, “A little bit of slope makes up for a lot of y-intercept.” For me, this is incredibly motivational. In January of this year, I decided that I wanted to complete a sprint triathlon. I had been running and biking for years, but I wasn’t a very good swimmer. So I joined the YMCA, and began swimming several nights per week. When I started, I could barely swim a lap without stopping to take a break. But each day, I got a little better. I watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJpFVvho0o4\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube videos about swimming technique<\/a> and talked with friends who swam competitively in college. Some days it was barely noticeable, but I got a little bit better. After three months of small, but consistent, progress, I was able to swim well over 400 yards (8 laps, or 16 lengths, in a 25-yard pool), and completed my first triathlon.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"graf--pullquote pullquote\">\n<div>If you do just 30 pushups each day, you will do 10,000 pushups in a year.<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>While I’ve enjoyed using incremental progress for personal endeavors, it’s also great for business, health, and relationships. If your goal is to grow revenue by $100k over the next fiscal year, landing one big deal sounds intimidating. What if you called one more customer each week? If you’d like to lose 20 pounds this year, you won’t do it all in one meal. What if you went on one more walk each week? If you want to grow closer with some friends or family members, don’t start by planning week-long visits. What if you shared one 15-minute call on your commute home each week?<\/p>\n<p>The challenge with incremental progress is discipline. It’s actually much easier to take big steps. Getting married is easy; you can do it in less than an hour in Vegas or Gatlinburg. Choosing to stay married each day for the next 50 years is hard. Competing in my triathlon was easy. I signed up, paid the fee, then showed up on race day. That was done within a few hours. The hard part was setting aside time each day to go to the pool, then actually going, even when I didn’t feel like it. Sometimes, I simply forgot or lost track of time. Discipline is hard when we try to accomplish it solely through willpower. Kelly McGonigal’s book <a href=\"http://kellymcgonigal.com/willpowerinstinct/\" target=\"_blank\">Willpower Instinct<\/a> talks about willpower as a finite resource. Over the course of a day, we make tough decisions, avoid unhealthy foods, stay focused at work, and our willpower reserves become depleted. After a long day, with most of my willpower gone, how did I make sure that I still got my swim practice each evening? I created a habit.<\/p>\n<p>Habits are systems that protect human beings from themselves. We get distracted. We get tempted. We forget about our goals. But habits are more powerful than our whims. Forming good habits allows us to make incremental progress toward our goals without trying as hard. Since we know that willpower is finite, we must have something more reliable than willpower, and habit fits the bill. Changing your habits can be difficult, but there are lots of ways to make the process easier. My secret weapon is the <a href=\"http://lift.do/\" target=\"_blank\">Lift app<\/a>, combined with the Lift team’s blog posts about habit formation. Charles Duhigg’s <a href=\"http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/\" target=\"_blank\">The Power of Habit<\/a> is interesting as well. The short list: find triggers, take small steps, track your progress, and reward yourself. Habits are how I read the Bible in a year, increased my sleep from six hours to eight hours per night, and learned to meditate.<\/p>\n<p>So, is all this worth it? For me, learning how to make incremental progress has been the most worthwhile lesson in my adult life. As Dustin Curtis reminded himself with his <a href=\"http://blog.stephengates.com/2009/09/18/the-death-clock-resume/\" target=\"_blank\">life remaining clock<\/a>, our time is always running out. My friend <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/aalap-majmudar/40/5b0/518\" target=\"_blank\">Aalap Majmudar<\/a> talks about his plans on the order of decades. I’m almost finished with three decades of life. I have an estimated five decades remaining. Most of the positive, meaningful experiences and achievements that I’ll have in those remaining decades will come not from single incidents like winning the lottery, going to a party, or visiting a place. Building a career, staying healthy, and maintaining relationships all happen in daily, small steps. Even this blog post is an example of the power of incremental progress. I’d like to write a widely-read book someday, but I’m not going to start and finish it tonight. Yet, with a little progress each day, we can do mighty things.<\/p>\n<p>By <a href=\"http://plus.google.com/+NickSuch\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Such<\/a><\/p>"

And I experience that feeling at it’s max when I get into the zone and optimize my productivity.<\/p>\n<p>Here are four tips for helping you get into the zone regularly.<\/p>\n<ol><li>Find your optimal flow time - For me this is midnight to 3 am.  It’s when I can crank, uninterrupted, and get tons of stuff done.  Some people work best in the mornings.  Figure out your optimal time and try to stick to it for an extended period of time (months at a time).  My biggest suggestion is that you have to avoid distractions - so if you find that your optimal flow time is, say the afternoons, then lock yourself in a closet and don’t let anyone interrupt (not always ideal for people with jobs that require meetings with other normal people on a regular basis).<\/li>\n<li>Determine your optimal flow environment - Maybe you’re more productive listening to music, maybe you’re more efficient with multiple displays, perhaps you need a coffee within arms reach, or maybe you work better in your boxers.  For me, it’s at my kitchen table, external mouse is mandatory, listening to music, drinking a Mt. Dew.<\/li>\n<li>Create a todo list - Create and reread your entire todo list before you start.  Check things off as you go.  It feels good.  If it’s not on your todo list, DON’T DO IT&hellip;unless it’s super urgent (but it rarely is).  I also recommend starting with the hardest things on your todo list.<\/li>\n<li>Reward yourself after the being in the zone - I go watch a tv show or a movie after successfully being in the zone for a few hours.  Either that, or I read blog posts by startup experts like <a href=\"http://okdork.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Noah Kagan<\/a> or <a href=\"http://feld.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Feld<\/a>.  Let yourself do something fun after being ultra productive.  Play a video game, hang out with friends, eat some double stuff oreos.<br/><br/><\/li>\n<\/ol><p>If you have other advice for getting in the zone, be sure to let me know in the comments section below.<\/p>\n<p>By: Brian Raney<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>Any entrepreneur will tell you the value of networking.  The more professional connections you can make, the more likely your business is to succeed.  That’s why my company jumped at the chance to meet and interact with people in our field from over a dozen countries at a global conference. On June 23rd and 24th, I attended the Worldwide Nursing Conference in Singapore as a representative of Quality Improvement Connections.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is Quality Improvement Connections?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Quality Improvement Connections, or QIC for short, is our family startup.   We focus on the creation and implementation of services that increase the quality of healthcare delivery and education.  My mother is a member of the Nursing faculty at Spalding University, and she provides the educational content and knowledge of the field.  It also doesn’t hurt that she knows people everywhere.  My father keeps us on the financial straight and narrow.<\/p>\n<p>My job is to take a body of under-utilized (largely) academic knowledge and turn it into a set of marketable products that can really help improve the state of healthcare in the region.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does QIC do?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The project we’re currently developing is an online course to teach genetics and genomics to nursing students, and the Worldwide Nursing Conference really acted as our our big reveal.  We spent six months planning to be ready at this event.<\/p>\n<p>This course has been developed following guidelines from the National Institutes of Health.  They’ve set a goal that all nurses and physician assistants should now receive basic instruction in genetics and genomics.  However, the academic infrastructure doesn’t yet exist to make this a feasible goal.  QIC aims to help bridge that chasm by offering a short, self-contained, web-based course in genetics and genomics that meets all the suggested competencies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why are we focusing on academic conferences?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our target market is composed of schools and academic faculty.  We’ve made the calculation/bet that traveling in the academic conference circuit will allow us to network enough to get several schools with the “early adopter” mindset to commit to using our product in the 2014-15 school year.<\/p>\n<p>I have to admit, even though we’re now flying around the world to present at an international conference, even though we’ve got an almost complete product on our hands, and even though we now have serious interest in our product from some pretty big names, it’s tough to shake the feeling that we have no idea what we’re doing.  I’ve read that that’s a feeling everyone deals with when they’re trying to start a business from scratch but it’s obviously an entirely different story to actually have that little seed of doubt.  I think I’ll be 50 before I stop asking myself, “Are we legitimate yet?”<\/p>\n<p>One of the ways to counter that, of course, is to get out and tell the world about our product.  The more people that see our presentations and view our content, the more people will realize we really know what we’re doing, and we’ll be able to continue building our reputation.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we know we need to be closing sales to be anything other than an advocacy group, but it’s tough to sell to someone who doesn’t yet understand the scope and value of our product.  As we spread the word this way, we’re also working behind the scenes on a more focused regional plan to get the business we need to keep expanding.  In the long term, though, growing the business will only be easier if people already have the name recognition that comes with things like conference appearances and presentations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Worldwide Nursing Conference was an excellent platform.  The presentation itself was, in my humble opinion, one of the best received in the entire conference.  We met several department heads and administrators from around the world who share an interest in using technology to augment healthcare education.  We made contacts with other professionals whose experiences can help guide our development.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, the paper was published in the official record of the conference, and my mother has already been contacted by another publication interested in the concept to expand on the original concept.  Even though we’re not exactly talking about Nature or Science, these journals are still an excellent way to get noticed by organizations with which we’ve not yet had face-to-face contact.  We’ve already received some attention via this avenue and, as we try to build a footprint in the academic world, amassing publications will continue to be a great way to establish legitimacy and reach a larger audience.<\/p>\n<p><span>We went to Singapore excited, hopeful, and nervous about the reception our ideas would have from a varied international audience.  We came back more excited, more optimistic, and convinced that we’re doing something that will catch attention and turn heads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>By: Ben Jacoby<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span> <\/span><\/p>",

Each year our team takes three days to break away from the daily grind and step back to look at the bigger picture or deeper purpose of our companies.  The trip includes a solid mix of strategy sessions, theoretical sessions, and fun activities.  <\/p>\n<p><br/>This year’s retreat, appropriately named the “AweSummit”, had a focus on “Why we do what we do?”<\/p>\n<p>It’s not a stretch to say that most entrepreneurs are a little bit insane.  Actually, it’s probably not a stretch to say that ALL entrepreneurs are CERTIFIABLY insane&hellip;and the more successful the entrepreneur, the more insane behavior you’ll observe.  Entrepreneurs have something that often appears to be illogical driving them to move forward.  An outsider could easily conclude they are out of touch with reality, that their confidence, optimism &amp; persistence are completely unjustified.<\/p>\n<p>Take for example the story of Pandora Radio.  Founder, Tim Westergren got rejected from investors over 300 times.  His company was on the brink of death.  He spent  years working for free and somehow managed to convince others to work for free as well.  <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/pandora-story-2011-6\" target=\"_blank\">More on the Pandora story here, if you’re interested<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Sound insane?  Probably so.  But I'd argue that an entrepreneur's appearance of insanity is actually just the manifestation of misunderstood <span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7791f051-9f85-5373-2246-485daa3fcb56\">passion (<a href=\"http://ctt.ec/J7nDj\" target=\"_blank\">click to tweet<\/a>)<\/span>.  And it’s that passion that keeps entrepreneurs going long after they should logically give up on a business.

The program caters to the individual needs of the startups it accepts and provides a timeline that is unique to each business. The Fellowship’s most recently accepted team is Pawn Metrics. They have created a web based app for taking inventory at pawn shops.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/awesomeinc/14328595817\" title=\"Mercury Pawn by Awesome Inc, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Mercury Pawn\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3846/14328595817_83542a5af7_n.jpg\" width=\"320\"/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><br/><span>The idea for Pawn Metrics came from founder Jacob Valenta’s experience working at a pawn shop. After witnessing the disorganization of the shop, Valenta created a web based app to help the shop do inventory. With the help of partners Ioan Ozarchevici and Jay Hamilton, Valenta’s program became Pawn Metrics, a complex system that allows pawn shops to efficiently take inventory in a way that’s easier than ever before. The website features new pricing methods similar to eBay, in an attempt to price items as accurately as possible, and a tagging system that greatly increases the speed of taking inventory. Pawn Metrics was introduced to the Awesome Fellowship Program through a recommendation from Ozarchevici’s boss, Scott Johnson, who is involved with several of Awesome Inc’s initiatives. Since being accepted into the competitive program, the Awesome Fellowship Program has helped resolve a few technical issues, as well as providing a ‘checklist’ to finalize the site and get it ready to market to potential clients. By emphasizing Lean Startup methodologies such as the importance of a minimum viable product and customer driven product development, Pawn Metrics is in the process of getting their site out to customers as quickly as possible. Valenta, Ozarchevici, and Hamilton are hoping to make their first sale to a pawn shop chain within the next two months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>By Sarah Hoffmann <\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc<\/a> works with high-tech startups to help them grow and mature in many different ways. One of the most important ways this is done is through the <a href=\"http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Fellowship<\/a>, which is a mentor-driven program designed to accelerate high tech startups. What is a good way to prepare for a fellowship with Awesome Inc? Start developing good habits now.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>There are two important performance metrics that you need to take into consideration when working towards accomplishing a goal. The first is tracking and measuring your activity.  The second is the end result: did you accomplish your goal?<\/p>\n<p>Google employees use something called an OKR or Objective and Key Results to help identify and accomplish goals. Both employees, managers and even the two founders of Google create an OKR each quarter that allows the participants to set their own goals that they would like to accomplish. This does not necessarily have to apply to your life as an employee, the ideas can be used in many different ways in your life (e.g., lose weight, write a novel or even start your own company). We will look at a very simplified version of this.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>First, you need to start out with SPECIFIC and MEASURABLE goals and then break them down into separate pieces. For example, if you are in sales, “selling more stuff” isn’t going to work. Change that to “increase my sales by 10% over the next quarter” and move from there. So, if you sold 90 widgets each quarter, your new goal would be to sell 9 more over the next 3 months. Break that down to 3 per month, that is less than 1 widget per week. The goals should be challenging, but not so challenging that you give up on them.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>An OKR can be used as a tool to help you identify where you are falling short of your goals and how to make sure that you can move forward and accomplish those goals. If you sold 4  widgets instead of 9 for the quarter, then you only hit 44% of your goal. What did you do to sell 4 more widgets and what did you not do that kept you from selling the remaining 5 to reach your goal? If you know that you made 5 more sales calls per month to reach 44%, then it stands to reason that an additional 6 calls per month would get you to your goal. That’s only 1.5 more sales calls per week. Remember, it is important to break your goals up into manageable pieces so that you don’t feel overwhelmed.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>The OKR needs to be shared with others who can help to hold you accountable for what you are working towards. This is not to be used as a punishment, but to be used as a way to help you understand and reach the goals you have set. If other people hold you accountable, you are more likely to reach the goal you have set, especially if the goals are front and center.<\/p>\n<p><span> <\/span>Now it is time for you to establish your own OKR with specific and measurable goals that are achievable but a little uncomfortable. Share your goals with others, you will need to evaluate them to learn from what you have accomplished and make the adjustments to your goals for the next quarter. This can help you to better understand your own strengths and weaknesses and to grow as a person. A great sense of accomplishment is experienced when you are able to set a goal, accomplish the goal, and reset for the next set of challenges that awaits.<\/p>\n<p><span>By: Steve Osowicz<\/span><\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p>On June 2, 2014 at <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/\" target=\"_blank\">WWDC<\/a>, Apple announced a new programming language called <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/swift/\" target=\"_blank\">Swift<\/a>. Let&rsquo;s take a look at why they created it and briefly highlight some of its pros and cons.<\/p>\n<p>The standard language for Apple iOS and OS X development is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C\" target=\"_blank\">Objective-C<\/a>. It is an extension of the original C language, a language that is notoriously difficult to learn and tricky to use. Apple proposes the Swift language as a replacement for Objective-C that is easier to learn and use. At least two other strategies drive its design: it should be interoperable with Objective-C, and it should be fast. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Swift Screenshot\" height=\"355px;\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Iom7RIC9-0xnW9EN5RsKn7K5xA0aw0zJxa5HiKKNcv5JcdkOQkq4x33FfT5qBwRqUBCLdE2p65nybzO4pxkDw0xNg7zkx27yQio0lKeSMoS5OchRK00vFQUIFmxdZplc9Q\" width=\"624px;\"/><\/p>\n<p>Swift brings language features that are familiar to and welcomed by many programmers today. It supports <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple\" target=\"_blank\">tuples<\/a>, multi-valued expressions that make it easy to write functions that return multiple values and allow shortcuts like assignment statements involving multiple variables. Swift also makes it easy to define functions that accept a variable number of arguments. It supports operator overloading, including custom operators. It supports natural string manipulation like a scripting language. Functions in Swift can be passed to other functions and returned by other functions. Swift is strongly typed, but types can be inferred. Swift includes generics (generic functions and generic types), anonymous parameters ($0, $1, $2, &hellip;), default arguments, and elaborate pattern matching in switch statements.<\/p>\n<p>Swift is designed to make the programmer less error prone. It does array bounds checking, it requires variables always to be initialized, it is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety\" target=\"_blank\">type safe<\/a>, it provides flexibility of syntax with semicolons and parens, and it requires the use of braces around the bodies of if-statements and loops (even if the body is a one-liner). It doesn&rsquo;t include pointers, per se, at least on the surface. Assignment statements cannot be used as conditions in if-statements. In fact, all conditional expressions must be legitimate Boolean expressions. There is no fall-through by default in cases of switch statements. All of these features eliminate common pitfalls in programming.<\/p>\n<p>Considering the way Swift is designed to feel more like a scripting language than a typical systems language, one might expect to see a trade-off in performance. According to Apple, however, Swift programs run even faster than Objective-C programs. The two benchmark results presented during the announcement at WWDC show Swift running 40% faster in one case and 73% faster in another case relative to Objective-C.<\/p>\n<p>The most glaring drawback to Swift is the simple fact that it is a new language, and for current iOS and OS X developers there will be an overhead cost to learning the new language and incorporating it into their practice. For businesses, there will be the cost of converting existing Objective-C code to Swift. However, this is mitigated by the way that Apple has developed Swift to work &ldquo;side-by-side&rdquo; with Objective-C, so it is not necessary to choose one or the other exclusively. Additionally, Xcode automatically generates Swift versions of Objective-C API headers.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few things missing in Swift. There is no exception handling. There are currently no concurrency features built in to the Swift language. Swift does not include garbage collection, instead relying on ARC, the same automatic reference counting mechanism used for Objective-C in LLVM. There is currently no access control (e.g., public, private, protected) in user defined types. Some of these omissions will undoubtedly be addressed in future versions.<\/p>\n<p>It is too early to judge Swift but based on the first few weeks of buzz in the community, optimism and excitement prevail for now!<\/p>\n<p>By Danny Thorne  <\/p>",

      "regular-title": "My Motivation for Launching Ignite: A Brand New Business Incubator in Ashland, KY",
      "regular-body": "<p>A question I have been asked by pretty much everyone I talk with about Ignite (a Cooperative Work Space and Entrepreneurial Center) is “WHY?” Why open this center in Ashland? What is your motivation? My answer has several dimensions: frustration when trying to start my first business because of not having a clear path to get help; the lack of guidance from a mentor when I had tons of questions as a new business owner; being overwhelmed by all the available resources and no direction on which would fit my needs; and the never ending acronyms (SKED, MACED, and SBDC). But mostly my reason comes from the love that I have for my home town and watching friends and young people leave the Ashland area for cities with better opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>‘I can’t wait to get out of this town.’<\/p>\n<p>That’s a phase I hear far too often. And as it turns out, local young adults ARE leaving. I recently listened to a presentation by Ron Crouch, Director of Research and Statistics with Kentucky Career Centers. Part of the presentation discussed population growth from 2000-2010 for each county. Not surprisingly, the counties along all the major interstates show an increase ranging from +3% to +41% (way to go Scott County!). What did surprise me, however, was the one lone county along Kentucky’s interstates showing a decrease – Boyd County – home to Ashland, KY. This statistic infuriates me.<\/p>\n<p>‘What company am I going to work for when I graduate?’<\/p>\n<p>I recently opened the Facebook page for Ignite (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/igniteashland\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com/igniteashland<\/a>), and one of the first comments someone put on the page said, “Small business is all we have here, now that’s not jobs.” Seriously. It’s still there, go look. I was absolutely floored by that comment, but it also convinced me that opening Ignite was the right thing to do and exemplifies one of my primary motivators – that people in and around my hometown think they have no other option for a job but to find employment with a large company. Locals put so much faith and hope in a large company locating to Ashland to bring more jobs instead of recognizing that small business means jobs! According to Forbes, 65% of new jobs created since 1995 have been small business.<\/p>\n<p>What’s the connection between “I can’t wait to get out of this town” and “what company am I going to work for when I graduate?” I think that half of the answer is that the latter causes the former. Graduates, whether high school or college, see no opportunity in Boyd County because most of them do not see doing something on their own or out of the norm as an option. No encouragement for entrepreneurs or startups. No support system in place. No ecosystem for startups.<\/p>\n<p>I recently received an e-mail from someone who read an article about Ignite in a local paper. Nathan Parks said, “I really liked your statement: ‘A problem in this area is young people grow up and ask ‘What big company am I going to go work for?’ I want to break that mold a little bit. I want them to ask, ‘What kind of company or product can I create to create jobs?’”  Nathan started a tech company in Ashland a few years ago and went on to say, “When I started HPCS I started from a similar place. I wanted a technology job but couldn’t find one so I just decided I’d make one. Being able to employ people now that actually appreciate having a tech job is pretty awesome.”<\/p>\n<p>Ignite is about ENCOURAGING those graduates to look at their home town and say, “Ok, I want to work in the field I love, but no one is doing that here. Awesome! Let’s start it.” <\/p>\n<p>By: Marty Myers<\/p>",

      "regular-title": "The Joy Project - Build a Bed",
      "regular-body": "<p>Growing up I slept on the top level of a red metallic bunk bed in a room shared with my younger brother.  Our matching bed sheets were decorated with a little bears dressed as astronauts and text that read, “One small step for a bear, one giant leap for bearkind.”   Each night, I would climb up the ladder and each morning I would heave myself over the side to land on my brother’s mattress.  <\/p>\n<p>Having such a cool bed is something that I took for granted.  Each night I knew that I had a comfortable and safe place to get a good night’s rest.  However, not all families can afford the high upfront cost of furnishing a bed frame, box spring, mattress, sheets, pillows, and blankets for all of their children.  Unfortunately, these children never get to experience the sense of security that comes with having a bed to call their own.  <\/p>\n<p>When members of the <a href=\"http://continuousjoy.org\" target=\"_blank\">Joy Project <\/a>learned that several local Lexington children were without beds, they decided to host a Build A Bed event to make a difference.  In order to maximize the impact of this event, they recruited over 30 volunteers to donate their Saturday building brand new beds and delivering them to children in need around Lexington.  <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/awesomeinc/14234391185\" title=\"Untitled by Awesome Inc, on Flickr\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Untitled\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2921/14234391185_7a95025791_n.jpg\" width=\"320\"/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>(Check out more pictures <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/awesomeinc/sets/72157644692785025/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>)<br/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The event kicked off around 10am in typical Awesome Inc fashion complete with Chicago Bulls style introductions for each volunteer.  The volunteers then split up into five teams and got to work.  After three hours of construction and staining, the teams had built six twin sized beds to be delivered.  The rest of the afternoon was spent cruising the streets of Lexington and dropping off the new beds, mattresses, and bedding for six incredibly grateful and deserving boys and girls.  One of the highlights of the day was seeing a young girl jump up on her brand new bed and enthusiastically shout, “This is just fantastic!”<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-05-28 at 10.53.18 AM.png\" height=\"467px;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/skY3xKKNl0RZ4m1VUTr0MbIaaolLbrga_z3slpmUyako59bWu5mKb7Mq6Os8GntoUlDUEf4sbgI3Ow1J1Ne8eGMoXRvoK_pg4YfRmW_TUwZgcwxsMHTQHcS454MWh3ba0Q\" width=\"301px;\"/><\/p>\n<p><br/><span>Thank you to all of the hard working volunteers who gave their time and energy to make Lexington a better place by selfishly creating joy for others.

Now, I don&rsquo;t think that crabs have rationalized that they are about to be dinner and they don&rsquo;t want their crab buddy to get out, but it is a good axiom for human behavior. If you have a dream you want to follow or an idea for a business, you should follow that dream. You will likely hear others tell you things like: &ldquo;that will never work&rdquo;, &ldquo;someone would have thought of that by now if it was a good idea&rdquo;, or &ldquo;but what about the security of your current job?&rdquo;.<\/p>\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc<\/a> rule #39: “80% of the success and 100% of the Awesomeness you experience in life is determined by those you surround yourself with. SO&hellip;Surround yourself with Awesomeness!” Take a look at your life, write down the five people that you spend most of your time with and signify each with a designated character A, B, C, D, and E. Next to these characters, write down what you think the goals are of these individuals and the level of success or happiness that these people experience. Examine the relationship you have with these people. What are the best qualities of these people? You can always take away something positive from the person and aligning yourself with people who are truly driven to succeed will impact you in a positive way.<\/p>\n<p><span> <\/span>Being around successful people who have that “spark” is contagious, they seem to emit a positive energy that will rub off on you. They have focused on a goal and are either working towards achieving that goal or have made it and are now reaping the benefits of their labor. Keep these people around you and learn as much as you can from them. The roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote (roughly translated) “It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” This is one of the reasons that when we find those successful people we strive to do more with our own life.<\/p>\n<p>The people you surround yourself with can help challenge you, which leads to innovation and personal growth. If you find that you are not where you want to be, whether it be career, life, or academics, find a way to create new relationships that will nurture and develop you. There is an old real estate adage, buy the smallest house in a neighborhood, the larger houses surrounding yours will increase your property value. The same concept applies to people, successful people that you keep around you will help to raise you up just by the nature of their company. Once you are there, be the mentor or friend that other people now aspire to be like.<\/p>\n<p><span>So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and get started!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>By: Steve Osowicz<\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p>After a few months of interning at Awesome Inc, I thought I’d try my hand at something most people in the building already knew: coding. But first, let me tell you about myself. I was a history major, where opportunities to code are about as nonexistent as my admissions letter to Hogwarts. My only other experience remotely relevant to coding was programming the thermostat in my house. It didn’t take long at Awesome Inc for coding to strike my curiosity –I saw people much younger and older than myself hunched over their keyboard with their gaze completely locked into the screen, seemingly pounding away producing colorful nonsense on the monitor. I couldn’t make sense of anything until the final product revealed some game, app, or website. Coding didn’t seem like my forte, but I figured I’d try my hand at it. One weekend I had the opportunity to attend an Awesome Inc U course for Android. I figured the best-case scenario was I’d become a coding prodigy and live a lifestyle similar to Tony Stark. The worst-case was a Saturday wasted in frustration, torture, and misery. The course advertised “No experience needed” and I was determined to test the veracity of that statement to the fullest. <\/p>\n<p>I arrived early Saturday morning with my other classmates eager to get started. I sat myself down in the seat furthest back so no one looking ahead would see my screen and judge my coding incompetence. We dove right in and soon enough I was entrenched in an Android maze of code. I typed away and the language became more and more familiar within a matter of minutes.  I double-checked my code in my virtual phone. It was amazing: I had functional (yet highly simple) app stacking text on top of each other! I left for lunch with renewed confidence. As most experienced coders know, this confidence was about to be shattered with a new challenge. Our new task as a class was to make a text-input system that would reproduce words onto a list. With the same vigor as earlier, I pounded away at my keyboard producing line after line of colorful code. Before I knew it, there was only one color highlighting my entire script: the red lines running underneath everything. The program did not offer a proposed solution to my errors or even attempt to decipher my intentions. I sat drowning in my shame with my confidence zapped. I mustered the courage to raise my hand and ask for help. Chris Allen, our instructor, quickly skimmed over my script. With immediate detection, he added a bracket to the beginning of my code and replaced an “O” with a zero. I was humbled, but my confidence had been restored. I ran the code onto my emulator and it was a miracle. I entered text into the box and each word popped up below. Each time I pressed “Enter” I was overcome with a sense of joy and pride.<\/p>\n\n<p><\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"777\" data-orig-width=\"1067\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jsg-318ksjbFD_pP-bcsC0yX3rSOUghoY9CU0ga-YBehOrDMUBYXssfh5oyrGvydo9zTayGVMtpYAvDkmI4vXoXPe6W6VHlTiSG3e1lDLD2-CqrxeQHev_arxUGRNmf_9Q\"><img alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-05-25 at 11.03.23 PM.png\" height=\"387px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/188a91f8ccfdd82e2cd046cccad814e0/tumblr_inline_pkifedIwQM1spm8pc_540.png\" width=\"532px;\" data-orig-height=\"777\" data-orig-width=\"1067\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jsg-318ksjbFD_pP-bcsC0yX3rSOUghoY9CU0ga-YBehOrDMUBYXssfh5oyrGvydo9zTayGVMtpYAvDkmI4vXoXPe6W6VHlTiSG3e1lDLD2-CqrxeQHev_arxUGRNmf_9Q\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n\n<p>In those few hours I developed a deep appreciation for those who were “code literate.” Coding required discipline and creativity, focus and imagination, success and failure. It was emotionally and mentally exhausting, but seeing those words appear in list form made all my efforts worth it. My point is, if I can do it, you certainly can. I have even moved beyond programming a thermostat with some small changes to the app I made in class that day and I look forward to learning new coding languages. Coding makes everyone capable of innovative, fulfilling, and fantastic work. Isn’t that all we should seek in an opportunity? <\/p>\n<p><span> <\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you want to learn to code, Awesome Inc U offers coding courses for all levels of programmers.  <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/#courses\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see the complete list of upcoming courses.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><br/><span>By Hamzah Khan <\/span><\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p>Code is the language of the 21st century. Computer programming is rapidly becoming an essential skill in every sector of the job world. To put it simply, <em>everyone is doing it.<\/em> But that begs the question, if coding is so important, why isn’t it being taught in schools?<\/p>\n<p>While many schools have computer science classes, there is still an overwhelming majority of schools that lack any sort of coding class. Computer science is a growing industry full of opportunities, yet so many kids have little to no exposure to that world. When the idea of adding coding classes to standard curriculum comes up, there are often quite a few common challenges that come up. <\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Kids don’t know what coding is.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That’s fair. As popular and essential as coding is becoming, a lot of kids are still in the dark about what ‘coding’ really is. Code is the “brains” of a computer. A computer’s code is its training manual. It’s how a program knows what to do when a button is pressed, a file is saved, and a window is opened or closed. Everything a computer can do is written in its code. Learning to code is like teaching an animal tricks. Computers can be taught to do math, draw pictures, sort files, search for things, and so much more.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Coding is too hard for kids to learn.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Coding is difficult; no one is going to deny that. But is it too hard for kids to learn? Not at all. Everything worth doing is hard at one point or another. Learning to code is learning a new language. Like languages, coding languages have rules and exceptions to those rules. There’s a style to it. Each language has different quirks that can make or break an entire program. It takes time and patience; there are basics that come first, but then the creative part comes in and there is an opportunity to make something amazing.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Coding is boring and kids won’t enjoy it.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Coding can be tedious and time consuming. The idea of spending hours sitting behind a computer may seem daunting to a lot of kids, but that’s because they don’t know what they have the potential to create! Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube, Netflix; all of these popular websites were made by computer programmers. Even with very basic coding knowledge, kids can make all kinds of programs that are sure to get them excited and motivated to learn.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Schools don’t have the resources to teach coding.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All it takes to have a coding class at any school is a qualified teacher, a computer lab, coding software, and kids who want to be in on the most innovative industry of the 21st century. <\/p>\n<p>The best way to open up the world of computer programming to kids is through schools or through alternative programs. Showing kids the ins and outs of coding can expose them to the all kinds of possibilities for their futures, as well as teaching them something that can be applied to so many different spectrums of life. There is no doubt that coding is important and will only continue to expand and advance as time passes. If computer science is the future, then it is important that the future generations can learn to love and grow the industry even more. <\/p>\n<p>A good resource to help introduce kids to coding is through <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc U<\/a>. They offer a <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/curriculum/#k12-week\" target=\"_blank\">Coding Camp<\/a>, a <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/curriculum/#k12-day\" target=\"_blank\">Day of Code<\/a> Program for educators, and <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/curriculum/\" target=\"_blank\">one day courses<\/a> for individual coding languages.<\/p>\n<p>By: Sarah <span>Hoffmann<\/span> <\/p>",

Some have gone on to thrive thanks to the guidance and funding provided by the contest.  This article features the success story of Kyle O’Donnell, a graduate of Western Kentucky University’s MBA program and a winner of Idea State U’s 2013 competition. After deciding against the idea for an ‘underwear-renting’ business, he went on to start an organic clothing line, won his division at Idea State U, and subsequently became one of Idea State U’s greatest success stories.  In this interview, he shares his new idea, his story, what life is like as an entrepreneur, and how he decided to <em>make<\/em> undergarments instead of <em>rent<\/em> them.<\/p>\n<p><span><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1062\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bglcKuHfv6zy7ZyVRPdPuSP7l091SkJi3qxAw61jIdW58DBjZwpIiSN2ETIAPBWuWbNo_0kuqltoM1zDEJCU36chBlUpwKERrPB1mUNG3E7mdpGW3Hcue52emiWBnRrULQ\"><img alt=\"Knitting_Machine_And_Packaging.jpg\" height=\"261px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef305a3c6630fa507bb4806bdc00a8d0/tumblr_inline_pk0h9lLkRN1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"359px;\" data-orig-height=\"1062\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bglcKuHfv6zy7ZyVRPdPuSP7l091SkJi3qxAw61jIdW58DBjZwpIiSN2ETIAPBWuWbNo_0kuqltoM1zDEJCU36chBlUpwKERrPB1mUNG3E7mdpGW3Hcue52emiWBnRrULQ\"/><\/figure><br/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.onlyfootprints.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Only Footprints<\/a> sells socks.  What makes your product stand out  and what’s the bigger idea behind it? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Well, the major difference is organic and eco-friendly.  For example, this past week you may have gone to the grocery store and noticed that they have organic certified food.  Well, you can also certify other crops organic, like cotton.  So I buy organic cotton wholesale and then try to communicate to people buying organic foods&hellip;that I also have this product that meets your values and preferences.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>As far as the feel goes, it’s very similar, but since it’s a premium product&hellip;I pay for processing steps like ring spinning the yarn and combing the yarn to make it exceptionally soft, that someone like Fruit of the Loom or Hanes will not.  They’ll use a cheaper process called open-end spinning.  So, in addition to being eco-friendly, I also try to pay for the premium processing so that it has the best softness.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>But when I’m at the farmers market I don’t try to explain to people the difference between ring spinning and open-end spinning, I just say “Would you like to feel this?” and then they touch it and their eyes light up and they say “Wow!  That’s a really soft sock!”<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you get the idea and did it go through any changes?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span> <\/span><em>My seed idea was to model a company called <a href=\"http://www.interface.com/US/en-US/homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Interface Carpet<\/a>.  They don’t sell you the carpet, they lease you the carpet.  So, interface owns the carpet, but it’s in carpet squares, so if anything ever breaks or if you spill on it, they’ll just replace that carpet square instead of replacing the whole carpet.  And so I thought what if we were to take this same leasing model and apply it to utilitarian garments like your undershirt, your underwear, or your socks.  But as I was telling my friends about it they said, “That’s stupid.  I would never do that. I would never buy those.”  So I changed my idea and branched out into organics and my friends that buy organic food were like “Yeah, I would totally buy some organic clothes.”  So it changed my initial idea but that change was important because it came from feedback from my initial customers.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1063\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tuAK1Tuzn7mnujahelmFEh1sW1M-wZCCVpLWRYCYTIooHHZlwprNybraVhkp4e_vDn4xrOrssNmrCZe6hmqsY872G0xrZyT9otVClNce1lm0Ws2zCPKyCuNXXTJl314ZNA\"><img alt=\"DSC_1007_edit.jpg\" height=\"282px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b1be8f24c8f90b9e72a3375ca91829c9/tumblr_inline_pk0h9lgZxk1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"324px;\" data-orig-height=\"1063\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tuAK1Tuzn7mnujahelmFEh1sW1M-wZCCVpLWRYCYTIooHHZlwprNybraVhkp4e_vDn4xrOrssNmrCZe6hmqsY872G0xrZyT9otVClNce1lm0Ws2zCPKyCuNXXTJl314ZNA\"/><\/figure><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you end up building your business in Kentucky?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>My undergraduate degree was in textile technology at NCSU, but  I came to Kentucky because of Western Kentucky University.  When I was looking at MBA programs I liked the sustainability electives at WKU&hellip;And then, because of Idea State U, I decided to stay here.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>How did Idea State U help launch your business?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>I submitted the business plan to the competition at the graduate level here at our school.  By working at the school level with the faculty I was able to refine the idea and take it from an idea to something real.  So Idea State U really helped me put the legs on the idea, really made the idea come alive, as opposed to just thinking about it intellectually and not really implementing it.  <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Where do you feel you’d be without Idea State U?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>If I didn’t win the prize money for Idea State U I wouldn’t have started my business because the capital cost was too high.  I did have some savings, but not enough savings to buy this big industrial knitting machine.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Idea State U changed my life.  If I didn’t win, I would have just been applying for jobs like everyone else and I would just be in some office somewhere doing excel or data analysis.  And I still do work with excel and data analysis but it’s my own work and work for organic causes and I’m really passionate about it.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1212\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/prFzM_uacO9PCFLA_59J4xr8D_mxO0v0gpyh688KmiQzvrQgJOYLNemGTrvGYREN54c03y1uBGmpobdEYnbTz33d4vhedZ3LyU8RTfDah0MYMqy4PSZie02Ryd0jjYeLHg\"><img alt=\"DSC_0999_small_edit.jpg\" height=\"265px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a39f4e3fe5217d1c828ad3dfe697737/tumblr_inline_pk0h9mJmcr1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"365px;\" data-orig-height=\"1212\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/prFzM_uacO9PCFLA_59J4xr8D_mxO0v0gpyh688KmiQzvrQgJOYLNemGTrvGYREN54c03y1uBGmpobdEYnbTz33d4vhedZ3LyU8RTfDah0MYMqy4PSZie02Ryd0jjYeLHg\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p><strong>What’s the best part of being an entrepreneur?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>This is my sole source of income and I live and breathe by doing this.  It’s very exciting. Every time you get an online order it’s just like your first online order (my first was on December 5, 2013).  And I hope always that I can make it and ship it out on the same day.  It’s very exciting.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>I think the best thing about being an entrepreneur is the freedom to set your own schedule.  So, for instance, in school you just have to deal with whatever you’ve been given but here at work, the post office doesn’t pick up until 7pm, so I often work late into the evenings, but then I don’t come into work until 10am, because it doesn’t matter if I make an order at 8am or at 2pm.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>A lot of people see you winning all this money and making it as an entrepreneur and think “Oh, he’s got success!  I could never do that.”  But we both know that even really successful entrepreneurs make mistakes and things don’t always go perfectly.  What has been your biggest mistake or failure thus far?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>I think my biggest mistake or failure was relying too heavily on Amazon to drive my sales.  Over half of my purchases come from Amazon, so I thought “I’ll just get an Amazon seller account, put my stuff up on Amazon, and the orders will be rolling in.  And that did NOT happen at all.  And so I really had to reposition myself to both sell through other online channels like ebay, Etsy, and my stand-alone store and sell at the farmers markets.  When I presented at Idea State U I just talked about online orders, but it turns out that selling at farmers markets and festivals here in Kentucky have accounted for about 40% of my sales.  <\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you say to college students that were going through the same process, thinking about applying to Idea State U, etc.?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>I think the biggest piece of advice I could offer to someone thinking to do this is to really think about how you’re going to get consumers to think about your product and evaluate your product when they are making a buying decision.  Like, I’m right next to a Big Lots.  There are customers that go in there and just buy Big Lots things, and my products will never get in front of them.  So, how can you find these customers when they have a willingness to buy and can they choose your product over substitute products.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Also, I think to overcome these difficulties, don’t look at what you’re doing now, look at month to month.  What did I improve?  How can I continue to improve?  So look at that first derivative and say “how much am I improving?” and “how can I keep improving?”<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><br/>By: <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/111114853802637128409?rel=author\" target=\"_blank\">Luke Murray<\/a><\/em><\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p>Helping fulfill Awesome Inc’s mission to create and grow local high-tech startups, the Awesome Fellowship program is designed to give startups access to a mentor network of more than sixty entrepreneurial experts, free office space, and an in-house graphic designer and web developer dedicated to growing each company with Awesome Inc <a href=\"http://blog.awesomeinc.org/post/65084038765/four-pillars-of-awesome\" target=\"_blank\">values<\/a> in mind. These resources are used to accelerate the growth of early stage startups participating in the program. There is a <a href=\"http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/apply.html\" target=\"_blank\">rolling application process<\/a> and the Fellowship is always accepting applications. The Fellowship is supported in part by the Cabinet of Economic Development. We have also received support and partnered with key people in the community such as Sizemore &amp; Sizemore accounting firm, Dinsmore &amp; Shohl law firm, and angel investor Chris Young.<\/p>\n<p>In March, we chronicled three teams in the <a href=\"http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Fellowship<\/a> <a href=\"http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Program<\/a>: Control My ADHD, You Saw Me, and Custom College Recruiting. This month we are providing a snapshot of their progress. After checking in with them, it is evident that all teams are making great progress!<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n<p><a href=\"http://yousawme.com\" target=\"_blank\">You Saw Me<\/a> founder, Seth McBee, made tremendous strides over the last few months including hiring a volume textile manufacturer, winning several pitch competitions, and securing $25,000 from the Bluegrass Angels. As recently as a week ago Seth was making each vest by hand. Although you can still find him wiring up vests by the Ping Pong table with the help of other members of Awesome Inc, textile professionals were able to offer new suggestion on materials. Seth says working around other members of Awesome Inc gives him “inspiration and energy to work harder.”  The Fellowship has allowed Seth to connect with mentors and he too has reciprocated that assistance by helping coach presenters at 5 Across. <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul><div align=\"center\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"496\" data-orig-width=\"661\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XN3lPye-G10coXHEvxHfecWiBpituC625Hi4HAkPJ-VJbCgirDDK9a14935X6hiq2le2KZbiz1PQXSfh7Mdn9HNbRdIuu7HDpWAJhcZ5KDbtlSp2c4ZEoXbqFudyn-AUoA\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"368px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dddebb84811f9f84987a0ca568d31a54/tumblr_inline_pk07s6HezA1spm8pc_540.png\" width=\"524px;\" data-orig-height=\"496\" data-orig-width=\"661\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XN3lPye-G10coXHEvxHfecWiBpituC625Hi4HAkPJ-VJbCgirDDK9a14935X6hiq2le2KZbiz1PQXSfh7Mdn9HNbRdIuu7HDpWAJhcZ5KDbtlSp2c4ZEoXbqFudyn-AUoA\"/><\/figure><\/div>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p><em>Seth McBee of You Saw Me receives guidance on manufacturing his vests.<\/em><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<ul><li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.controlmyadhd.com\" target=\"_blank\">Control My ADHD<\/a> founder, Grant Weherley, recently released a new course and the month of March posted the best revenue figures thus far. He is also focusing on different partnership opportunities to offer the course to people who need it the most. Currently, Grant is working from the Philippines and credits the Fellowship for allowing him to “focus more on the big things like moving the company forward without stressing about side issues like figuring out how to use Photoshop.” The Fellowship aims to allow entrepreneurs to allocate their energy into what is most vital.

      "regular-body": "<p>On Tuesday, April 22, the Awesome Inc U team decided to flashback to their high school days and make an appearance at STLP’s State Championship at Rupp Arena. STLP (Student Technology Leadership Program) is a Kentucky program that teaches kids of all ages the operation and creation of technology through a series of project-based competitions. Essentially, it’s a club available to kids from elementary school to high school where they can get together, make cool tech stuff, meet like-minded peers, and get recognized for the cool stuff they do (you can learn more about STLP <a href=\"http://stlp.education.ky.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>).<\/p>\n<div align=\"center\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"761\" data-orig-width=\"1020\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Gb2bOlWsZP61aPwp8qfjbjeWt1AJON6TzhoPswJZJQMyMipHudtbjgYWTGBgXfKumGQQukC4FZBy8Vvx5FtQ4w2escN5NWisIgiwCNbltIfhnV0m3QpLzQ-QToPHW1uVDQ\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"242px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/662557e55f1073378ae910dd078d4a78/tumblr_inline_pk2vhljIbU1spm8pc_540.png\" width=\"325px;\" data-orig-height=\"761\" data-orig-width=\"1020\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Gb2bOlWsZP61aPwp8qfjbjeWt1AJON6TzhoPswJZJQMyMipHudtbjgYWTGBgXfKumGQQukC4FZBy8Vvx5FtQ4w2escN5NWisIgiwCNbltIfhnV0m3QpLzQ-QToPHW1uVDQ\"/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><em>(Check out more pictures from the conference <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/awesomeinc/sets/72157644267540985/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>!)<\/em><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>The genuine interest and enthusiasm shown by the STLP kids was remarkable. We came with the goal to promote Awesome Inc U and expose as many kids as possible to basic coding principles. We were blown away by the response of students at the conference. Students were incredibly intelligent and were picking up on coding principles at a pace that would have made Mark Zuckerberg proud.  It was refreshing to see so many kids with a genuine passion in learning how to code. What started as a computer and a few iPads soon turned into a jumble of laptops, tablets, and other devices pulled from the pockets of the Awesome Inc crew in an attempt to satisfy the unceasing tide of kids waiting to code their own Angry Bird game. (If you’ve never tried the Angry Bird learn to code game, check it out<a href=\"http://learn.code.org/hoc/1\" target=\"_blank\"> here<\/a>.) The overwhelming sentiment of the day was that there is a huge number of young kids with a desire to learn how to create their own stuff using computer programming. Unfortunately this demand is not being met in many schools across the state and country.<\/p>\n<div align=\"center\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1022\" data-orig-width=\"758\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BBfUQbhZKdEw2LUy7BbdaXs6YtgciNgGouX4_xF9extBUsgE-q8fgvAOcP8_5LYZyJNXylwRTT4y-k3tqBvXT8oFv7VJUnm7w-lXnhA3G5heCwtLYjLAitNFjzZKAhnK9g\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"307px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b7ed908251df57b11656e550fe2d0f24/tumblr_inline_pk2vhm1LCy1spm8pc_540.png\" width=\"228px;\" data-orig-height=\"1022\" data-orig-width=\"758\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BBfUQbhZKdEw2LUy7BbdaXs6YtgciNgGouX4_xF9extBUsgE-q8fgvAOcP8_5LYZyJNXylwRTT4y-k3tqBvXT8oFv7VJUnm7w-lXnhA3G5heCwtLYjLAitNFjzZKAhnK9g\"/><\/figure><\/div>\n<p>The good news is that there are many outside opportunities and venues for kids to learn how to code. For starters, Awesome Inc U is offering a Week of Code program this summer from July 8th to 11th. It’s similar to a summer camp, except a lot cooler &ndash; students will create their own website, mobile app, and video game, all the while acquiring skills in a plethora of programming languages (additional information can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/curriculum/#k12-week\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc U website<\/a>). Awesome Inc U also offers Hour of Code classes for local schools and a wide variety of one-day programming courses. Information on both of these can also be found on the previous link.<\/p>\n<p>The enormous amount of interest by Kentucky’s youth is evidence that the Commonwealth has a huge pool of young, talented, and interested minds ready to jump on any opportunity they get to learn more about coding. Programs like STLP are great because they provide kids an outlet to pursue their passions. Awesome Inc U works to further their opportunities by teaching kids tangible programming skills that can be utilized for the rest of their lives to accomplish their goals and dreams. Both of these programs are great, but it is up to the community as a whole to support these kids in their endeavors and cultivate an environment where any kid with the desire to learn has the opportunity to do so.<\/p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p><strong>Join the #LearnToCode movement and register for the Week Of Code <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/kids-code-camp-weekofcode-tickets-9821589639?aff=aincwebsite\" target=\"_blank\">today<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>A complete listing of Awesome Inc U’s coding classes can be found <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/#courses\" target=\"_blank\">here!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n<p>By: Ben Childress<\/p>",

Jimmy Valvano would be proud of me today, because I’ll have no problem laughing, thinking and crying all in the same day.<\/p>\n<p>Five years ago, myself and a few of my best friends embarked on a journey to grow the entrepreneurial community in Lexington.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"193\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7fQp_--SBpbvp1vYJfUg9F7fw3g4padvlrYnPVsPYpB3PALLEm0l1rZD9mQeyCrjEb1jt07Uxf8_zjdAZSoNz58vkrjTrRXQKbXySyLH_qIni8fAJKpsB3983wYD7g\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"182px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e2ed5accab7d0edccc907794bc22460/tumblr_inline_pk1d4fGbgm1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"939px;\" data-orig-height=\"193\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7fQp_--SBpbvp1vYJfUg9F7fw3g4padvlrYnPVsPYpB3PALLEm0l1rZD9mQeyCrjEb1jt07Uxf8_zjdAZSoNz58vkrjTrRXQKbXySyLH_qIni8fAJKpsB3983wYD7g\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>To say that we knew what we were doing, where we were going, or even had an ounce of understanding of what was to commence is a flat out lie.  It was more like trying to navigate through a dense fog when you can’t even see your hand two feet in front of you.  What we did have though, was a mission that we all believed in and the right combination of ambition, passion, willpower, and ignorance to think we could accomplish that mission.<\/p>\n<p><span>The story of the Awesome Inc’s first five years leads to the two most important lessons I’ve learned as an entrepreneur - 1. Do something&hellip;seriously, anything.  Just do something because something is always better than nothing &amp; 2. Surround yourself with the right people in order to maximize success.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Something -<\/strong> <\/p>\n<p>Since our mission was to grow the entrepreneurial community in Lexington, we started out by looking around the country at some truly awesome entrepreneurial communities.  We visited three in particular - San Francisco, Boulder, and Austin.  It’s worth noting that Boulder’s population is only about 100,000.  Lexington’s is about 300,000.  Austin’s population in 1995 was about 500,000.  The themes we noticed in these cities were simple:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n<p>People worked on stuff they cared about.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>People started things quickly.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The entrepreneurs worked REALLY hard.  <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Some things we noticed that were NOT necessarily true:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n<p>People in these cities were not any smarter than the people in Lexington.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>The startup ideas that these entrepreneurs were working on weren’t any better than startup ideas we’ve heard in Lexington&hellip;in fact many of them were the same ideas.  <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Our biggest takeaway - do something fast.  So, we launched a Startup Weekend event and within a few months had 75 entrepreneurs hanging out to work on about 10 different companies for a weekend&hellip;awesome!  A few months later we rented out 6,500 square feet on main street and opened up a co-working space, mostly so we would look and feel “official”.  This enabled us to try experiment after experiment and discover the intersection of our abilities and the needs of entrepreneurs in Lexington.  <\/p>\n<p>We had many failed experiments, like <a href=\"http://www.nextington.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nextington<\/a> - a series of TED-like events OR giant touchscreen displaying interactive maps.<\/p>\n<p>We had experiments that served their purpose but are no longer running anymore, like <a href=\"http://mobilexconference.com\" target=\"_blank\">mobileX<\/a>, a series of mobile technology conferences throughout the midwest that eventually transformed into our coding school, <a href=\"http://awesomeincu.com\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc U<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>And we had experiments that succeeded and have persisted, like the co-working space, our internship program called <a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/team-alpha/\" target=\"_blank\">Team Alpha<\/a>, the <a href=\"http://5across.org\" target=\"_blank\">5 Across pitch contest<\/a>, <a href=\"http://entrepreneurhof.com\" target=\"_blank\">The KY Entrepreneur Hall of Fame<\/a>, and our Accelerator/Incubator program (now: <a href=\"http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Fellowship<\/a>).<\/p>\n\n<p>Through these experiments we were constantly learning, optimizing, and moving faster with every attempt.  Each one was designed to fill a void that we noticed in the entrepreneurial community and ultimately allow some subset of the population to pursue their definition of awesome.  We discovered that the main ingredient Lexington was missing was that people didn’t feel like they had permission to fail and subsequently wouldn’t try (to read more about how we feel about failing, check out <a href=\"http://blog.awesomeinc.org/post/65067426325/failing-in-order-to-succeed\" target=\"_blank\">this blog<\/a> or <a href=\"http://blog.awesomeinc.org/post/65146476414/how-to-get-people-to-fail-more\" target=\"_blank\">this one<\/a>).  This cultural difference was what separated cities like Boulder, SF, &amp; Austin from cities like Lexington.  <\/p>\n<p>We even went as far as to create a Failure Dashboard and place it in a prominent location in our co-working space for people to post their failures.  <\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_uVTjnwu-_Cw3jt0FS19NrRXJ_WEYnFLIadN5gvGcd0TbBfZAjq7Q8cEWMmENi9SwPjwvpxsjBDgpNXiLE1lB9i5fM6Fc1_hv3vsj2crIGo1tO8URFYQzt6ocUdRbQ\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"365px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b34072b3317bf89785ef17ad52a777d5/tumblr_inline_pk1d4gWsQS1spm8pc_540.png\" width=\"273px;\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_uVTjnwu-_Cw3jt0FS19NrRXJ_WEYnFLIadN5gvGcd0TbBfZAjq7Q8cEWMmENi9SwPjwvpxsjBDgpNXiLE1lB9i5fM6Fc1_hv3vsj2crIGo1tO8URFYQzt6ocUdRbQ\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>We celebrated those failures as much as we celebrated the successes.

If it wasn’t for the incredible team that I’ve been able to surround myself with, not only would we have failed much more often, I would have quit this venture a long time ago.<\/p>\n\n<p>About 2 years into Awesome Inc I remember sitting in the conference room after facing a series of failures in a row and asking myself, “Why am I doing this? What’s the point in continuing?”.  I was on a low on the rollercoaster and considering throwing in the towel.  I remember the moment vividly when the distraught feeling of inevitable continuous failure turned to hope and excitement and I was reminded why I wasn’t going to quit.  I looked around the office and saw the members of my team working on their various initiatives.  I thought to myself, “With these guys on my team, we’re going to figure this out&hellip;we’re going to win.”<\/p>\n\n<p>The mission of Awesome Inc is not near complete.  There are still people in our community that don’t get to pursue their definition of awesome.  But if the next 5 years provide us with the adventure, challenges, and pure joy that the last 5 have, I’ll be laughing, thinking and crying and truly living every step of the way.<\/p>\n<p><span><br/><\/span><\/p>\n<p>rule #4: “Always Do Something Awesome over Something Not Awesome”<br/><br/><\/p>\n\n<p><em>By: Brian Raney<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><em>Co-founder, <a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc<\/a><\/em><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span><br/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><u>A few of the people that have influenced the culture and direction of Awesome Inc:<\/u><\/p>\n<p>Bert Berry - Intern that helped start the Hall of Fame, solid, reliable dude that actually has a productivity index named after him at Awesome Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Therese Henrickson (aka: captain) - Our first employee, the most loyal person you’ll ever meet.  The smartest thing we did in the first 3 years of Awesome Inc was to hire Therese.<\/p>\n<p>Garrett Ebel - Originally an intern, now Program Manager at Awesome Inc.

We owe Jay a lot and can’t wait to pay him back someday.<\/p>\n<p>Gina Greathouse (aka: Aunt Gina) - Even though there is no blood relation, we call her Aunt Gina because she treats her adopted startup nephews like family.  Gina has been super supportive to everything Awesome Inc has done over the past 5 years.<\/p>\n<p>APAX Software - Keith, Matt, Justin and team - the entrepreneurial community of Lexington will probably never be able to repay the debt owed to the APAX team for the sacrifices they’ve made.

      "regular-body": "<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>As the Winter Olympics in Sochi drew to a close last month, Awesome Inc’s Olympic Committee was just convening. The latter edition included Jamaica (coldest month: January with average lows of 76°), Falkland Islands (a mere penguin’s swim away from Antarctica), Mexico (whose lone medalist in Winter Olympic history is an Austrian prince), and Iceland (home to zero McDonald’s restaurants). Each team fought valiantly in a mixed bag of events featuring skeleton on a challenging hardwood surface, a controversial broomball tournament, a hybrid triple jump/ring toss event, ga-ga, and four-way dodge ball. <figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VmSjWkapQXCtXzTM_UvUKJ9xriIWFKhWDt_2qNStbiG6x9uukdQTkm0l0r7StOIos6bEfh2QhBGe-Qf62v3hYN6kk7lq_Lj5_sBAId9H9-Lwn6eucrqXHWLaV70dfw\"><img alt=\"1656001_10101830507300620_1306334572_n.jpg\" height=\"180px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/502b58a29361dc25ab5296a6781a3d46/tumblr_inline_pk3dyxRd8c1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"240px;\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VmSjWkapQXCtXzTM_UvUKJ9xriIWFKhWDt_2qNStbiG6x9uukdQTkm0l0r7StOIos6bEfh2QhBGe-Qf62v3hYN6kk7lq_Lj5_sBAId9H9-Lwn6eucrqXHWLaV70dfw\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p> <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>After an ostentatious opening ceremony that included a burning torch, the games were christened. This year was not without drama either: the Mexican delegation to the games (headed by our very own Garrett Ebel) accused the dramatically successful Iceland (captained by Theresa Simcic) team of continually cheating. These allegations included using a non-IFBA approved stick for broomball*. However after further inquiries, the rulebook had no specific standing either way on using a household Swiffer. Further scrutiny was attached to the Iceland squad when Tommy Crush, a local legend in the interpretive dance world, had to perform the higher honor of judging the competition. Despite his national ties, Falkland Islands dazzled the crowd with a passionate and inspired performance and rightly took home the gold. Jamaica’s local take on Mulan’s “I’ll Make a Man Out of You,” was a real crowd pleaser featuring action, romance, the burdens of war, and props. The athletes’ favorite was a dodge ball competition including all nations. All four teams were placed in a quadrant with balls lined up across the middle. The entire game consisted of four matches and teams employed varying tactics. Falkland Islands retreated into their corner in a phalanx formation being opportunistic with their chances. Iceland, perhaps too eager from their medal count, failed to develop any strategy until the final round. Andrew Shields, who spent a larger part of his youth training with the late Patches O’Houlihan, anchored Mexico. Shields was frequently the last remaining member of his team. Despite each nation’s late bid to boost their respective medal count, a favorable training environment, superior leadership, and unrivaled cohesion allowed Iceland to capture the overall competition. The true spirit of the Olympics was again on display during the closing ceremonies and everyone was reminded of rule #17: Bring the fun.<\/p>\n<p>.<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LGAEBLrthfEgE4dbWewBJ_yWCtAS4rxLjsP6i7W28lQDtF-3g0s5IQ9BWer94b8VjqJf2NCw840vzARSOgW8RtAnkebdsxGybj_A-vJoZh36UNxkT-BBwaUBn2WHRw\"><img alt=\"1925278_10101830508218780_1987963132_n.jpg\" height=\"195px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b95e564483fbfa2f90b39bc126422b89/tumblr_inline_pk3dyxTq0K1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"260px;\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LGAEBLrthfEgE4dbWewBJ_yWCtAS4rxLjsP6i7W28lQDtF-3g0s5IQ9BWer94b8VjqJf2NCw840vzARSOgW8RtAnkebdsxGybj_A-vJoZh36UNxkT-BBwaUBn2WHRw\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3R-Sf0Qf3aM7AvmJDNZSwo2_Ao8ZSq0bFE6CAZSDEfVPKoCoDgztW2Ccy_WE-UsJANEib7nxg8nNk3sw5Xpm18_HAFmKJIkpRZO-oN53ZeIEM-xZWFdQzn8ylAJn_g\"><img alt=\"1959447_10101830507605010_1590711767_n.jpg\" height=\"173px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff698b97a5bb66abc111977b9d67edd4/tumblr_inline_pk3dyyzyCH1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"230px;\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3R-Sf0Qf3aM7AvmJDNZSwo2_Ao8ZSq0bFE6CAZSDEfVPKoCoDgztW2Ccy_WE-UsJANEib7nxg8nNk3sw5Xpm18_HAFmKJIkpRZO-oN53ZeIEM-xZWFdQzn8ylAJn_g\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p><br/><span><\/span>*IFBA (International Federation of Broomball Associations, the governing body) has since ruled Swiffer is not a permissible substitute for a broom, it will not be allowed from any IFBA-sanctioned event henceforth.

      "regular-body": "<p>Get ready for the big question. The question that, right or wrong, people will judge you by.  People will subconsciously categorize you by your answer to this question. People will feel like they know who you are because of your answer. What sort of question could elicit such a response? No, nothing about religion, marital status or whether or not you eat tofu. The question is: “So, what do you do?” A person isn’t asking what your hobbies are, what you do for fun on the weekends, or even what your contribution to the betterment of mankind is; they want to know what kind of work you do. Believe it or not, this can actually be a golden opportunity to “sell” someone on your ideas, products, and services. A finely crafted elevator pitch will allow you to best market yourself and your venture whenever you are asked this pivotal question.<\/p>\n<p> An elevator pitch is a short, concise representation of what it is that you do. It is named after the amount of time you would have to make a short presentation during a ride on an elevator. This pitch should be under 1 minute, but probably closer to 30 seconds to make sure you keep the other person’s attention.The elevator pitch should center around your company’s main purpose. For example, if you build houses, make sure that the other person understands that is what you do. It is important to highlight how your product or service is different from competitors and why that makes yours better (e.g. why the way you build houses should be chosen over other options). It is also crucial that you convey passion and excitement about what you’re pitching. Is selling dog blankets exciting for you? Express that in your pitch. Give the other person enough information so that they understand what it is that you do, and how it can benefit them. Make sure you ask them a question or give them an opening to ask you about your product or service. Finally, smile when you are giving your elevator pitch. Smiling can have a mood boosting effect on others.<\/p>\n<p>Are you looking for a job, have a startup, or maybe still in school? If so, make it a habit to talk to people and inform them about you and what you’re looking for. Even a student can give an elevator pitch to try and find summer work or an internship. If you are in sales an elevator pitch should be a very important tool in your arsenal &ndash; use it and you will certainly receive more leads.<\/p>\n<p>Follow the steps below to create your own elevator pitch.<\/p>\n<p>1.  <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Briefly detail your main goal with your product or service<\/p>\n<p>2.  <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Explain why your idea, service or product is better than the competitors<\/p>\n<p>3.  <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Express your passion through the pitch<\/p>\n<p>4.  <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>30 seconds to 1 minute<\/p>\n<p>5.  <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Practice your pitch (time yourself)<\/p>\n<p>6.  <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Smile, smile, smile<\/p>\n<p>7.  <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span>Don’t forget, you’ve already come this far, ask for his or her input. You are not trying to “close” a sale on a person with an elevator pitch rather gauging their level of interest.<\/p>\n<p>Below is a sample elevator pitch for a fake company, Widgets-R-Us, that builds mobile applications for schools.<\/p>\n<p>“Our company, Widgets-R-Us, solves a need for instant communication between parents and faculty at grade schools through high schools all throughout the tri-state area. Since many of us here at Widgets-R-Us are parents as well, we understand the need to know and be updated when there is a school emergency, meeting or cancelation as soon as possible. With our apps, we can connect parents with faculty and allow them to relay information about non urgent matters such as school game highlights and scores, contact information, and changes in curriculum. We can also allow feedback from parents on items such as changes to the dress code. Do you know any parents or teachers that would find that useful?”<\/p>\n<p><em>Where can you learn more about entrepreneurship and pitching ideas?

      "regular-body": "<p>Zig Ziglar, famous author and motivational speaker said, “You can have everything in life you want, if you will just help other people get what they want.”<\/p>\n<p>This is advice that every entrepreneur should take.  I’ve been spending a lot of time lately trying to get inside my customer’s head &ndash; actually walk in their shoes, sit in their desks, relate to their problems, experience their joy.  For most people, myself included, this doesn’t come all that easy.  To truly understand another person and the way they think is against our natural self-seeking behavior.  However, it’s often the key to building and then selling a successful product or service.<\/p>\n<p>You’ll notice that the best sales people let the customer do most of the talking.  They just react to what the customer says and adapt their pitch accordingly - “so safety matters to you, well this car has a 5 star safety rating”, or “you’re on a budget, I totally understand.  This car gets efficient gas mileage”.  The only way you can read the customer and react appropriately is if you actually LISTEN, relate to that person, and then give that person what they said they want.  So, really it all starts with listening.  In order to help others get what they want, you have to be an excellent listener.<\/p>\n<p>The very best entrepreneurs are often the very best listeners.<\/p>\n<p>A few more influential people that think focusing externally vs internally is a good strategy for success:<\/p>\n<ul><li>\n<p>“You&rsquo;ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards” - Steve Jobs<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/good.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Make something people want” - Paul Graham<\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>“There is only one boss.

      "regular-body": "<p>A lot of people have awesome ideas.<\/p>\n\n<p>A lot of people have awesome ideas they want to turn into an awesome business.<\/p>\n\n<p>But very few people can say that they have all the resources they need to get their ideas off the ground, let alone shape them into a successful brand.<\/p>\n\n<p>Enter the Awesome Fellowship. Introduced this fall, the program aims to grow 6-10 high-tech startups in Lexington in the year 2014. Companies are selected for the program through the <a>online application<\/a> process. Selected teams receive access to the mentorship network, introductions to investors, and access to the Fellowship’s own graphic designer and programmer. The Awesome Fellowship is supported in part by <a href=\"http://bizlex.com/2013/11/state-grants-37500-to-awesome-inc/\" target=\"_blank\">a grant from the Cabinet of Economic Development<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Fellowship has so far accepted three startup teams into the program: Control My ADHD, You Saw Me, and Custom College Recruiting.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.controlmyadhd.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Control My ADHD<\/a>, in the words of founder Grant Weherley, “focus[es] on positive, proactive methods that allow people to take ‘control’ of having ADHD, rather than just being labeled as having a ‘disability.’” Weherley explains that, while not intending to replace medical treatment, his company hopes to provide alternatives for those who find medication or other methods inadequate. In addition to helping affected individuals control their symptoms, Weherley also strives to make an impact on a larger scale. “I see my company helping shape societal perspective towards ADHD several positive ways, while training large numbers of people on simple, everyday methods for improving symptoms, so they can really take ownership of their ADHD,” says Weherley,  “rather than feeling disabled by it.” Weherley adds that the most valuable service the Fellowship has provided has been “having an entrepreneurial community backing my project and to reach out to;” furthermore the design and programming assistance has been extremely helpful as well.      <\/p>\n\n<p>Also new to the Fellowship is <a href=\"http://yousawme.com/\" target=\"_blank\">You Saw Me<\/a>, headed by Seth McBee. You Saw Me is focused on “making visibility safety active, custom, fun for walkers, runners, bicyclists, and anyone wanting to be bright.” The company markets reflective safety vests with the added visibility of color-customizable embedded LEDs. After recently moving to Lexington in order to focus full-time on his company, Seth was drawn to the Fellowship as an opportunity to grow it into the brand he envisions. “Awesome Inc naturally came up as a resource,” says Seth.  “Their excitement for those with the passion to go from idea to concept to market really drew me in and their willingness to help me is why I&rsquo;m still there.” Of the benefits of being a part of the Fellowship, Seth says, “I&rsquo;ve realized there are tons that go into producing a brand new consumer good and it&rsquo;s hard to be flawless throughout.  The ability to use experts for things I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself close at has been extremely valuable in allowing me to do what I am good at, all while maintaining that powerful image I plan on building.  So far, this has been web development, graphic design, and on-the-spot mentoring.”   <\/p>\n\n<p>The third company currently a part of the program is <a href=\"http://www.customcollegerecruiting.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Custom College Recruiting<\/a>. Founded in 2010 by former collegiate basketball coach Shane Howard, CCR aims to “get [prospective college basketball] players what they truly need in the recruiting process. Education, evaluation, and exposure.” The service helps student athletes across the United States and the world get noticed by college coaches in both NCAA and NAIA divisions.  By consistently sending a scouting report&ndash;including basic stats and video of the player&ndash;multiple times per month to coaches, “the idea is that if a coach overlooks or misses the info one week, but may in fact have an interest ultimately, then they will eventually see it,” explains CCR’s website.  Shane, drawing from personal experience, says, “I was coaching at a small college and found that there was really no way for players to properly evaluate their abilities and verify their talents to college coaches,” a void which CCR now helps fill. Shane hopes to see CCR continue to grow into a leading recruiting service and says that “having a great support group of proven winners in the startup space” has been the most valuable part of his participation in the Fellowship.<\/p>\n\n<p>It has been great welcoming these teams into the Awesome Inc community, and we are excited to do the same for even more in the near future.<\/p>\n<p><em>By Sydney <\/em><em>Toth<\/em><\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p>The people around you are a bigger influence than you expect. That’s why it’s important to surround yourself around high-quality people. Sometimes quality people are hard to find like finding a frozen 20 dollar bill in the parking lot. However, that’s not the case at Awesome Inc. In fact, Rule #37 at Awesome Inc is to “Surround yourself with Awesomeness.&ldquo; I’m always surrounded by great people at Awesome Inc and they have definitely influenced me for the better during my time here. I walked into Awesome Inc a skinny high school senior with little experience. Now I’m a skinny college freshman hardened by the tough world of startups. It wasn’t always like that.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Being a super chill guy, assertiveness was very foreign to me. So one time after working on 5spot, I got a text from Garrett that basically told me to be more assertive. It reminded me of a classic Spongebob episode where Plankton teaches Spongebob to be more assertive. At one point, someone sits on Spongebob but he’s too nice to do anything about it. Here’s a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h01ZetY0cPE\" target=\"_blank\">link<\/a> to the scene. I was in the same unassertive boat as Spongebob. I used to have trouble with little things like giving my opinions or telling the waiter that I didn’t want tomatoes on my sandwich. Now my sandwiches are happily tomato-free thanks to Garrett’s advice.<\/p>\n<p><span> I feel more comfortable sharing my opinions now. Becoming assertive is still a work in progress but I’ve been looking towards role models such as Kanye West and Mitch McConnell for inspiration. This change wouldn’t have been possible if I wasn’t surrounded by positive influences at Awesome Inc. Contrary to what they said in high school, peer pressure can work wonders to your productivity. You just have to make sure it’s the good kind.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rule #37: Surround yourself with Awesomeness<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><em>By Jake Tapia<\/em><\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p>I’m an intern with Team Alpha at Awesome Inc. Team Alpha is not your average internship. Before I interned with Awesome Inc, I interned at a law firm but never did any sort of lawyer stuff. I was pretty much the second secretary but at least I had my own office. All I did was sign thank you cards and organize files. Another time I had to shop for a replacement phone on Cricket because the lawyer had lost his iPhone the day before.<\/p>\n<p><span><br/><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Team Alpha is different. Instead of stereotypical intern work, Garrett, Theresa, and the others find put you to work on projects right away. My first project was to email famous big time entrepreneurs for Rockstar Wall autographs. Before this, my only experience with email was typing it into Facebook to login. It turned out to be pretty successful and I got to ring the Success Bell for the first time after receiving Bill Gates’ autograph. I’ve learned more than just how to email billionaires over my tenure with Team Alpha. Event planning, coding, and pitching ideas are a few of the skills that I wouldn’t have been able to learn anywhere else. <\/p>\n<p><span><br/><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/N-PCDB-2MJKMaLfp3lK2RddGVxSRXcGnX53zalCXlk-8BF6pFzfIc4AHngbJIjoolg68a5Yrp4hE90cveDrIu38uMVEEzHdwBlnzK6CwdzJnVr2b77ZAXDKrZg\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"357px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2828d1dcb700e56c8e2acf3ac943bf41/tumblr_inline_pkieyn1WsM1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"476px;\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/N-PCDB-2MJKMaLfp3lK2RddGVxSRXcGnX53zalCXlk-8BF6pFzfIc4AHngbJIjoolg68a5Yrp4hE90cveDrIu38uMVEEzHdwBlnzK6CwdzJnVr2b77ZAXDKrZg\"/><\/figure><br/><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The best part about Team Alpha are the Team Alpha members.

Everyone at Team Alpha embodies the overused “work hard, play hard” cliche all over <a href=\"denied:about:blank\" target=\"_blank\">rap music<\/a>. A lot of times, working hard is playing hard since we always look for a way to mix the two. <\/p>\n<p><span><br/><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Team Alpha isn’t an average internship.

      "regular-title": "The Question Every College Graduate Asks - How to Find the Right Job?",
      "regular-body": "<p>Choosing a job is a big decision.  Probably, the only place you spend more time than your job is your bed.  <\/p>\n<p>I get to work with a lot of college students who are about to graduate.  Some of them are interns at <a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc<\/a> or <a href=\"http://www.apaxsoftware.com\" target=\"_blank\">APAX Software<\/a>.  Others are students in various program at the University of Kentucky where I serve as the Entrepreneur In Residence.  One common issue facing all these students is “how do I find the right job upon graduation?” (<a href=\"http://ctt.ec/F1Q1H\" title=\"click to tweet\" target=\"_blank\">Click to Tweet<\/a>)<\/p>\n\n<p>My advice lies in the answers to these two questions:<\/p>\n<p>1. Will you enjoy it&hellip;a lot?<\/p>\n<p>2. Can you be successful at it?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can you enjoy it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It’s important to realize that this question isn't “Can you tolerate it?”  This question trumps the 2nd question.  If you aren't happy, it will be much more difficult for you to be successful.  And even if you can find success in an unhappy career, it’s not fulfilling.  <\/p>\n<p>The most important component to finding happiness in your job is the people around you.  Working with great people can allow for any task to be fun.  I’ll always remember the first year we opened up Awesome Inc and would host events on the weekends to make ends meet.  The events were often parties that would end with our space being a complete wreck.  My business partners and I would find ourselves cleaning chewing gum off the floor with a kitchen knife and a cube of ice at 2am.  This doesn't sound like fun, but it was actually a great time.  And it was only fun because I was doing it with fun, positive people.  <\/p>\n<p>In addition to working with great people, you have to believe in the mission of your work and believe that your work (the specific role that you are playing) matters.  Assisting in the completion of your company’s mission is often far removed from the completion of your individual tasks so it’s critical that you can see the connection.<\/p>\n<p>Jon Acuff, author of the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Start-Punch-Escape-Average-Matters/dp/1937077594\" target=\"_blank\">Start<\/a>, gives a great example of this. He small talks an Apple customer service rep during a typical call and asks the rep if she enjoys her job.  He expects to get an answer like, “It’s ok.  It pays the bills and in today’s economy, I’m just lucky to have a job.”  This is about the most positive answer that I’d expect from the service rep as well.  I mean, think about it.  They listen to people complain all day about their problems with the latest Apple devices.  No one ever calls just to say, “Hi, I was just calling to let you know that I’m really happy with my new iPhone. Tell your company nice job. Have a great day!”<\/p>\n<p>However, the service rep surprised him with this answer instead, “I love my job.  I enjoy doing two things - helping people solve problems, and learning new things.  I get to do that all day long.”<\/p>\n<p>This rep understood 1. what made her happy - helping people &amp; learning things and 2. how her job fit into the greater purpose of Apple - ensuring that people who bought these great products got the most out of them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can you be successful at it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This one is a little trickier and takes time.  Ironically, this one is also very dependent upon on how much you enjoy your work and the people around you.  <\/p>\n<p>The best way I've learned to predict whether I will be successful at something is to compare myself to people that have already been successful at the same thing.  Ask yourself questions like, “Do I possess the same skills as these people?”, “Do I have a similar background?”, “Do my values line up with these people?”, “Are my personality traits similar to these people?”, “Do I like the same things as these people?”<\/p>\n\n<p>Another thing to remember is that you have to put in reps to be successful.  It doesn't happen overnight.  It takes time.  <\/p>\n<p><strike><span><br/><br/><\/span><\/strike><\/p>\n<p>Here are a few litmus test type questions you can ask yourself about your current or future job that might be indicative as to whether not you have the “right” job?<\/p>\n<ol><li>How much do you look forward to Friday over Monday?  It’s ok if you look forward to Friday, but if you absolutely dread Monday and start looking forward to the weekend before noon on Tuesday, you might not be that happy at your job.<\/li>\n<li>Are the people around you just “average” at what they do or are they “exceptional”, at least in some ways?<\/li>\n<li>When you check your watch and it says 4:55pm, are you super excited that you get to go home or are you a little disappointed because you wanted to get more done that day?<\/li>\n<li>Do you actually like your co-workers? Would you hang out with them outside of work?  Would you go on a road trip with them?<\/li>\n<li>Are your supervisors pushing you to be a better overall person (not just focused on making you better at serving at the company, but really investing in your professional and personal development)?<\/li>\n<\/ol><p><em>By Brian Raney<\/em><\/p>",

And it is magical.<\/p>\n\n<p>I cut my programming teeth on hand-coded PHP websites. The time saving benefits of `echo $header;` showed me the power of using programming even for basic web templating purposes. A few dozen Wordpress sites later, I began to get frustrated with the maintenance overhead and meandering speeds, especially when WP is hosted on inexpensive vanilla web servers. While there are many solutions to these problems, I began to notice a few things about our sites, and the engineer in me began to think that Wordpress was not ideal. First, I realized that while we make frequent content changes to our site, from the user’s perspective, it is a static site. When one user visits our site, he or she will have the same experience as another user who follows a few minutes later. If our site only changes when we push changes to the site, why does Wordpress regenerate each document whenever it’s visited? While proper caching could solve this problem, we were still burdened by the pain of maintaining a Wordpress installation over time. Our Web Team at Awesome Inc is meant as a training program for aspiring developers. Working with students on semester-long internships, we have lots of team member transitions. This makes it tough when we built a Wordpress site 9 months ago, and nobody from that original team is around when we need to update Wordpress and its (often flaky) set of themes and plugins. Once again, this is not a knock on Wordpress (it’s an amazing tool) nor our Team Alpha members (this may be their first site ever, and we encourage them to <a href=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lc63ingGof1qz6pqio1_500.png\" target=\"_blank\">move fast and break things<\/a>). This comes down to applying the right tool to the right job, and WP was no longer it for our needs. So that’s when we turned to <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jekyll<\/a>, a static site generator from <a href=\"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/graphs/contributors\" target=\"_blank\">the folks<\/a> who started Github.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, with no further ado, here are the top 5 reasons we love Jekyll:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Hosting via Github Pages<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The great part about serving our static site from Github Pages is how fast and reliable the service is. Oh, did I mention that it’s free? An added bonus in using Github for a coding school like ours is the ability to showcase our code as part of our courses. And on more than one occasion it has been critical to be able to make an urgent change from my mobile phone, say while our team is out at <a href=\"http://www.keeneland.com/racing/app\" target=\"_blank\">Keeneland<\/a> or at a Kentucky basketball game. With Github, I can make changes to any text file in the repository right from my web browser.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Git workflow<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Source control was one of the top things on my list for our Web Team members to learn, as the ability to efficiently and effectively collaborate with a team is important for developers in both startups and large companies. When something changes on our website, I want everyone to know who made the change, when they made it, and why. Oh, and it’s pretty nice to be able to revert if we break something! It’s also handy to be able to deploy with a simple `git push origin master` (or a click of “Commit &amp; Sync” on the <a href=\"http://mac.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Github Mac App<\/a>) instead of using a clunky FTP client.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Templates<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The lack of templating features was the first thing to annoy me about simple HTML-only static sites. When we needed to add Google Analytics, make a change to a footer link, or reign in an errant CSS selector, we had to repeat these same changes across ALL of our pages. With 1 or 2 pages, this was fine. With a growing assortment of landing pages and Awesome Inc U course schedules, this became tedious. Fortunately, Jekyll and its implementation of the <a href=\"http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid templating language<\/a> came to the rescue! We moved all of our header and footer content to a file in the `_layouts` directory. We have a massive table that lists all our programming courses, and this table needs to show up on 3 different pages, so that now lives in the `_includes` folder. And there are some fun projects that our Web Team will be tackling soon to keep our content as fresh as possible, thanks to the time-saving features of templates.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Pretty URLs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I’m a stickler for pretty URLs. Then again, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI\" target=\"_blank\">so is Tim BL<\/a>. When we <a href=\"https://github.com/ainc/AwesomeIncU/tree/de46ac17a0e087c95326bba35d4bc03d54202d32\" target=\"_blank\">first launched AwesomeIncU.com<\/a>, everything ended in a `.html`. While this is not necessarily a faux pas (even simplicity-obsessed Apple shows <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/specs.html\" target=\"_blank\">some .html pages<\/a> on their site), I like to conceal implementation details as much as possible. If there’s one thing I know about the world, it’s that technology will change in the future. Then it will change again. There are plenty of options to rewrite pretty URLs, but the one of the simplest ways is to nest your actual pages inside a directory, and name them the Apache default of `index.html`. While this works great on the deployment side, it’s ugly to work with from a development side when all your files are called “index.html”. Sadface. Fortunately, the simple line `permalink: pretty` in your `_config.yml` file will take care of this for your whole Jekyll site.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Plugins<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is actually our most debated “love” for Jekyll. The ability to extend Jekyll’s native set of functions is great, and there’s already a decent swath of plugins available for what you’re most likely to need. We’re huge fans of <a href=\"https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_alias_generator\" target=\"_blank\">aliasgenerator<\/a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kinnetica/jekyll-plugins\" target=\"_blank\">sitemapgenerator<\/a>. The downside is in making those plugins work nicely with Github Pages. By default, Pages runs in `&ndash;safe` mode, meaning that your plugins (which are .rb Ruby scripts) don’t get processed by Github’s servers. It’s still possible to work around this. In fact, we’ve found at least 2 ways to do this. The first option is to host your code on Github, but use a post-receive hook to host your _site directory on a web server. You get all the collaborative benefits of Github, and you still get a decent speed increase by serving static pages instead of a dynamic Wordpress site with its PHP scripts and database access. The second method is a bit more complex, but quite elegant in that it allows you to still serve your entire website (source and _site contents) on Github. Huge thanks to the team at Nitrous.io for sharing their <a href=\"http://blog.nitrous.io/2013/08/30/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rakefile setup<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, those are a few of the reasons we love Jekyll for building websites. The team at Development Seed has some great insights on <a href=\"http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/\" target=\"_blank\">why they made the switch to Jekyll<\/a>, which helped influence us to join the club.

The Bluegrass Development Business Partnership was pleased to be the lead financial sponsor of this program which is a great asset for the entrepreneurial community.

I come from the world of science and research, so while I may give research talks on multiple occasions throughout the year, a business pitch is a completely different animal, so thank you!<br/><br/>PowerTech Energy is a compilation of research engineers including me, James Landon, and other research scientists including Cameron Lippert and Kunlei Liu. Our purpose is to develop more efficient technology towards power generation that meet and exceed the environmental needs of the current generation and those of the future. I think to some, power generation can be a somewhat boring topic, but when you think about the things you do everyday — charging your phones and laptops, turning on your lights, and putting gas in your car — you may realize just how incredible some of this stuff really is and how much we may take it for granted. As the world population continues to grow, the importance of clean power generation with minimal impact to the environment will be even more important.<br/><br/>The technology we’re working on right now is a highly efficient water treatment device that can easily remove salt molecules from water. The first market we are targeting is the water used in our many research laboratories across the country. These laboratories rely upon ultraclean water to run consistent, reliable experiments. Current water treatment devices are expensive, inefficient, and require constant maintenance. The solution to this issue is the development of a device that treats water in a new manner. As the business grows, we see opportunities for this water treatment device in a variety of new markets including wastewater treatment and personal water consumption. The average person can use up to 100 gallons of water per day, not a small sum, so we see the possibility of increased growth with the development of these new markets.<br/><br/>The money won through the 5 Across competition will go a long way towards our business growth. We have already used some of the money in a provisional patent filing for part of the technology and will continue to pursue intellectual property protection. We will also continue to develop critical business and manufacturing contacts in the community and will use some of the money to develop a website showcasing some of the technology for possible business partners. Finally, over the next few months, a larger-scale prototype will be constructed that will be capable of meeting the laboratory water treatment market discussed earlier. As a small business, every little bit of money helps a tremendous amount. The business contacts we gained through this competition have already proven to be invaluable as well. Thanks again to everyone at Awesome Inc, and we look forward to the new year and new opportunities ahead!<br/><br/><em>By: James Landon<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.5across.org/a-word-from-2013s-5-across-winner/\" target=\"_blank\">Originally posted on 5 Across Blog<\/a><\/p>",

I knew that I was there to learn, but I had no clue how absolutely brilliant and driven all the people there were. But one thing always stood out as a crucial background of Awesome Inc: coding and programming.<\/p>\n\n<p>Whoa, I felt behind, because I had never taken one class or learned anything about it. It was just a foreign language that I didn’t feel like I needed to know, simply because I felt like it wasn’t my area of expertise, nor would it ever be. As a few months progressed, I realized that my wanting to learn how to code wasn’t coming from any sort of pressure, it came from the excitement that Awesome Inc provides.<\/p>\n\n<p>When you’re at Awesome Inc, you tell someone of your work, and they reply, “Awesome”, it makes me smile. Awesome Inc exists to create an awesome environment, so when I found myself itching to learn and be part of a community that knows how to do these amazing things, I couldn’t have been more proud to be part of this place.<\/p>\n\n<p>I took that itch to learn how to code and finally signed up for the <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc U<\/a> Basic Web Development Course. Again, I had never tried to learn how to do this kind of stuff before. I didn’t know what any of it meant or how people even understood it. All I knew was that I wanted to have some sort of understanding of what it all was.<\/p>\n\n<p>That Saturday, I was kind of nervous because I thought that everyone would know more than me and I’d fall behind, but full of hope and enthusiasm, I had a blast at the class and learned more than I ever thought possible. It turns out that the basics of this supposed language isn’t that difficult! Granted, I took an introductory class, but at least having a grasp of what was going on made me feel like I could do something with it and really apply it. A couple hours of learning and having fun reminded me of why I love being a part of Team Alpha and the overall Awesome Inc community. Everyone, no matter what, is here to grow as a person and as an intellect, and that’s what being awesome is all about.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>By: Meredith Scroggin<\/em><\/p>",

      "regular-body": "<p>After spending the summer interning at Facebook, I get asked on a pretty regular basis “So what do I need to do in order to get a job at one of those big tech companies?” I don’t mind the question, but I’m not always sure they’re ready for the answer.<\/p>\n<p>Let me back up a minute. My name is Tommy Crush, I’m a senior at UK, and I’ll be going on full-time as a software engineer at Facebook next summer after successfully interning there last year. About two years ago, I got involved with Awesome Inc and started a company with my cofounder David Booth. I was the sole engineer, and David handled business development.<\/p>\n<p>I’m not going to detail what we built, or how we did it, because it’s not relevant to how I got the internship. The only important part of that story can be summed up in another way: “I proved that I knew what I was doing by actually doing it.” In terms of self-marketing, that concept is the single most powerful straightforward no-explanation-needed statement that one could possibly make. And it worked.<\/p>\n<p>I’m the first to admit that I’m not smartest software engineer at UK; in fact I’m not even a computer science major. But I’m likely one of the few students who could claim “I was the sole engineer for a company that had real code, real clients, and real problems.” Awesome Inc provided the entrepreneurial community to keep me going when the going got rough.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you position yourself to beat out Ivy League students applying at top tech companies? Do something they’re not: build. Sure, take your studies seriously; but your classes alone will not get you there. Get involved with an entrepreneurial community. Seek out opportunities to solve real-world problems. Write real code. Find something you’re passionate about. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org\" title=\"Awesome Inc\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc<\/a> is a great place to start.

      "regular-body": "<p>Let me start off by saying Noah Kagan is a pimp. He recently published <a href=\"http://www.appsumo.com/sumo-jerky/\" target=\"_blank\">this article<\/a> about how he made $1000 (in profit) in 24 hours selling beef jerky subscriptions. What a piiiiiimmmpppppp!<\/p>\n<p>He titled the article <a href=\"http://www.appsumo.com/sumo-jerky/\" target=\"_blank\">The Results of the 24 Hour Challenge<\/a>. Being the competitive entrepreneur that I am, I wanted to take the challenge. With a Startup Weekend Lexington event just a couple weeks away, I decided that would be my opportunity to try to start a $1000 business. My plan &ndash; attempt what Noah did in 24 hours in a full weekend. And when I say “what Noah did” I mean exactly what Noah did.  Beef Jerky Subscription Service.  Period.  I “iterated” on the idea exactly zero.  Just ‘stole it’ and executed like crazy for two days, along with the seven other people on my team. Here are the results:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Subscriptions needed to hit $1000 profit:<\/strong> <em>244<\/em><br/><strong>Subscriptions needed per hour:<\/strong> <em>9.4 (based on 26 hours of actual work)<\/em><br/><strong>Total Subscriptions Sold:<\/strong> <em>267<\/em><br/><strong>Total profit:<\/strong> <em>$1095<\/em><br/><strong>Total revenue:<\/strong> <em>$5340<\/em><br/><strong>Hours worked:<\/strong> <em>26<\/em><br/><strong>Beef Jerky Consumed:<\/strong> <em>100+ ounces<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Website where you can order some awesome beef jerky:<br/><a href=\"http://www.awesomejerky.co\" title=\"Awesome Jerky\" target=\"_blank\">www.awesomejerky.co<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Since Noah already wrote about the process, I’ll focus on what I learned. I kept a log throughout the weekend, which you can find at end of this post.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, what did I learn:<\/p>\n<ol><li>\n<p><strong>Sales are hard<\/strong> - Most entrepreneurs I know avoid doing sales for as long as they can.  That’s because it’s usually the hardest part. Too bad it’s the most important part and avoiding it only delays answers to important questions about your business. No one likes asking people for money. You just have to suck it up and do it. Early Saturday, several members of our team were saying, “I’m not up for this. These people don’t want what we’re selling and I feel bad pushing it on them.” It was cool to see the transformation occur over time and by Sunday afternoon everyone was on their phone closing sales. Like anything - the more you do it, the more comfortable you get. Get comfortable with being told no. Also, you have to believe in the product you’re selling. If you don’t, it’s going to be tough to push your product.<br/><br/>If you need a pump me up before doing some sales calls, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izOIOvguncU\" target=\"_blank\">watch this scene from Boiler Room<\/a>.  We watched this whenever we felt ourselves losing steam.<br/><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KiMtlOWkDm7jgE8SwOI7EQ2M0B1zyQoFNm9ZdF_tlA2yAXuTvU1Pmd8Z1-Poa55yMLsXlTpq9vrJW-KgYlQeMxdEZfFFwNuGtM8MKTAsWoGbBPVpfdJ3Oa6-9Q\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"244px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/46a8bcf5925850595476182e83e0c4dc/tumblr_inline_pk1002dG0G1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"326px;\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KiMtlOWkDm7jgE8SwOI7EQ2M0B1zyQoFNm9ZdF_tlA2yAXuTvU1Pmd8Z1-Poa55yMLsXlTpq9vrJW-KgYlQeMxdEZfFFwNuGtM8MKTAsWoGbBPVpfdJ3Oa6-9Q\"/><\/figure><br/>Above: our team closing the final sales about to hit the goal<br/><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Acquiring customers is ALL that matters<\/strong> - nothing else; not the website, not a logo, not a fancy demo. Props to Anthony Bosschem for figuring this and writing a cool post about it here - <a href=\"http://anthonybosschem.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/how-i-got-my-first-customers-without-having-a-product/\" target=\"_blank\">How I got my first customers without having a product<\/a>.<br/>Within the first hour, we had a <a href=\"http://awesomejerky.co\" target=\"_blank\">landing page<\/a> and paypal account setup.  It wasn’t the prettiest system ever, but it was enough. Our domain name didn’t even work until about 5 hours in so we were directing people to a long ugly github link.  We found errors with our paypal buttons all the way into the 30th hour. Who cares.  What we had was enough to sell beef jerky delivery subscriptions. Everyone knows what beef jerky is, so all we were doing was finding people that wanted more of it and wanted it delivered to their door.  <br/><br/>We had to resist the urge to do things like offer free samples, come up with a cooler domain name, make a promo video, add extra descriptions to our website, or offer other product lines.<br/><br/>One quick aside &ndash; before we started the weekend we weren&rsquo;t certain if we wanted to sell beef jerky subscriptions or healthy snack box subscriptions (i.e., Naturebox). So, we decided that we’d focus on beef jerky, but also offer healthy snack boxes to people that don’t like beef jerky. We’re probably going to be kicking ourselves when we have to fulfill the snack box orders, but ultimately, it did help us reach the $1,000 mark.  We sold about 50 snack box subscriptions and the rest were beef jerky (out of our 262 total sales).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol><ol><li>\n<p><strong>Your customer is not everyone <\/strong>- If they aren’t buying, move on. I spent over an hour on one potential customer. Granted it was on Facebook chat while working other leads, but he didn’t even buy. An entire hour and no sale! I spent another hour on a customer that did eventually buy a three month subscription, but I quickly realized the hour wasn’t worth it. Here’s the deal: if they aren’t interested, don’t waste your time. It’s not personal. Maybe they don’t like beef jerky, maybe they don’t have the money, maybe they just watched Home Alone 5 and thought it would be better than the previous 4 and now they’re taking it out on you. Whatever it is, it doesn’t matter. Move on to someone that is interested. Another note on this &ndash; if your potential customer is having serious hesitations before buying, this is a good sign that they are going to be a high maintenance and/or flaky customer that you don’t even want.  Also, if said potential customer is a friend, you are probably straining the relationship more than the sale is worth if they’re having serious hesitations about spending $20 on some meat.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol><li>\n<p><strong>Determine what works and focus on it<\/strong>… this takes discipline.  <br/>We started off with low hanging fruit &ndash; close friends and family. Then we went to Facebook messaging people that were online, then gchat, then texting/phone calls, then Twitter. It was hard to measure what was working and even harder to focus on it once we determined what was working. It’s so easy to get distracted by that new friend that just signed onto Facebook when what you need to be doing is calling up the business owner that might buy 6 months for his office. Our team would run 1-2 hour sales sprints and then we’d regroup to see what was working.  After each sprint we would track our sales and see where they were coming from. We kept a tight feedback loop. We found out that Noah was right &ndash; real time communication wins. 90% of our sales came from real time communication, things like phone calls, texts, Facebook messages, gchat.<br/>The majority of our sales came from our own network. This is typical and can eventually become discouraging because you don’t think you can ever scale with this strategy. But just remember &ndash; Facebook started at Harvard with Mark Zuckerberg’s closest classmates first. It then scaled after he proved and perfected the model with his early adopters. Everything works this way, so it’s okay if you aren’t closing lots of random people through Google Ad campaigns at first.<br/><br/><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"384\" data-orig-width=\"686\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DrJer4hVGkNyLdQIJCpHQXA9JeO95PN_rk6IjtL1JhpCyUlyS7pTXc9HWbGM20YcK6bVvYvFqbhIXsa0QcODDcscYsyHhsYL2jHB7gewX2RDGi2MpZjfMuLxfw\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"349px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bf1eac2c4925befaf97a2a1652cfb7b1/tumblr_inline_pk1003MVwq1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"624px;\" data-orig-height=\"384\" data-orig-width=\"686\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DrJer4hVGkNyLdQIJCpHQXA9JeO95PN_rk6IjtL1JhpCyUlyS7pTXc9HWbGM20YcK6bVvYvFqbhIXsa0QcODDcscYsyHhsYL2jHB7gewX2RDGi2MpZjfMuLxfw\"/><\/figure><br/>Our team in all out sales mode on Saturday afternoon.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol><li>\n<p><strong>Success only happened because I had a rockstar Startup Weekend Team<\/strong> <br/><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/r14TRtS2QXDyAyv6fIe7w06tXSIFfnA-QLRR9gGlL036wTI2qnZmWcrkwJqlSIZzMQPIZCvHtofA5F5f2FWD79VS0s9641jSR3hhSRjYfDCSxUbH8mMEvriB7w\"><img alt=\"image\" height=\"251px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7c3973fc2dd3b8500631d27b2db8c74b/tumblr_inline_pk1003D9tg1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"335px;\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/r14TRtS2QXDyAyv6fIe7w06tXSIFfnA-QLRR9gGlL036wTI2qnZmWcrkwJqlSIZzMQPIZCvHtofA5F5f2FWD79VS0s9641jSR3hhSRjYfDCSxUbH8mMEvriB7w\"/><\/figure><br/><br/>I might have already said this, but Noah is a huge pimp for doing this alone and in 24 hours.

      "regular-body": "<p><img alt=\"Kids learning to code with CSEdWeek logo\" src=\"http://blog.awesomeincu.com/images/hour-of-code-promo.jpg\"/><\/p>\n<p>Like many things, the hardest part of learning to code is simply getting started. Fortunately, the world has gone ahead and made this part MUCH easier for you, than it was for, say, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper\" target=\"_blank\">Grace Hopper<\/a>. There are a plethora of <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">free resources<\/a> available on the web, many employing onboarding methods that will have you churning out lines of code before you even realize your new-found love of the semicolon key. And if these resources weren’t enough for you to start dabbling in software, our friends at Code.org have dedicated a week in December to give you a swift kick in the pants to jumpstart your practice of programming: the <a href=\"http://code.org/hourofcode\" target=\"_blank\">Hour of Code<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like most challenging creative tasks, writing software comes with a sort of activation energy hurdle that aspiring practitioners must overcome. It took me a significant amount of energy and focus just to write this blog post, but by far the most challenging part was actually sitting down and beginning to type. If you have had the experience of learning to cook, learning to play a new sport or instrument, or attempting to become conversational in a new spoken language, then you’ve experienced the same core challenge of learning to code.<\/p>\n<p>I’d argue that the actual process of learning to code is actually much easier than any of these things. Software has this amazing property of being rooted in human logic. There was no such logic to aid me when I first learned that the plural of Goose is Geese, or that it was humanly-possibly to contort my hand into playing a barre chord on the guitar. Additionally, software is such a recent invention that many of the inventors are still around, here to share tactical advice as well as insight into the philosophy of the languages and frameworks they’ve created. Could you imagine being able to ask the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar#History\" target=\"_blank\">inventor of the guitar<\/a> why she chose 6 strings over 4 or 8? For at least a short while, the equivalent is quite possible with programming, and the path to doing so is as short as buying a ticket to PyCon or <a href=\"http://rubyconf.org/\" target=\"_blank\">RubyConf<\/a>, or just <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gvanrossum\" target=\"_blank\">tweeting at Guido van Rossum<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I want you to commit to just get started. Pick just one hour during national <a href=\"http://csedweek.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CS Education Week<\/a>(December 9-15) and do something. If you know a K-12 school who would like to bring the Hour of Code to their classroom this December, let us know how <a href=\"http://awesomeincu.com/hourofcode.html\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc U can help<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And if all else fails, hit me up on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aerosuch\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter<\/a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nicksuch\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> and I’ll sit down with you 1-on-1 for an hour.<\/p>\n\n<p><em>By: Nick Such<\/em><\/p>",

The weekends culminate with presentations in front of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for critical feedback.” The top two teams from this year’s Startup Weekend Lexington were The Recovery Station and Deckvex.

However, I’ve been around one language for all my life but I still don’t know how to “speak” it. That language is HTML. It’s one of the most common languages used for web development and can be found anywhere on the Internet. <\/p>\n<p><strong><strong><br/><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Taking a class at <a href=\"http://www.awesomeincu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc U<\/a> is going to change that.

      "regular-body": "<p>Let me start off by saying Noah Kagan is a pimp. He recently published <a href=\"http://www.appsumo.com/sumo-jerky/\" target=\"_blank\">this article<\/a> about how he made $1000 (in profit) in 24 hours selling beef jerky subscriptions. What a piiiiiimmmpppppp!<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong><br/><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He titled the article the 24 hour business challenge. Being the competitive entrepreneur that I am, I wanted to take the challenge. With a Startup Weekend Lexington event just a couple weeks away, I decided that would be my opportunity to try it. My plan - attempt what Noah did in 24 hours in a full weekend. Here are the results:<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong><br/><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Subscriptions needed to hit $1000 profit: 244<\/p>\n<p>Subscriptions needed per hour: 9.4 (based on 26 hours of actual work)<br/>Total Subscriptions Sold: 267<\/p>\n<p>Total profit: $1095<\/p>\n<p>Total revenue: $5340<\/p>\n<p>Hours worked: 26<\/p>\n<p>Beef Jerky Consumed: 100+ ounces<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong><br/><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Since Noah already wrote about the process, I’m not going to focus on that in this post. Instead I’ll focus on what I learned. I did keep a log file throughout the weekend, which you can find at end of this post.<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong><br/><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, what did I learn:<\/p>\n<ol><li>\n<p>Sales are hard - Most entrepreneurs I know avoid doing sales for as long as they can.  That’s because it’s usually the hardest part. Too bad it’s the most important part and avoiding it only delays answers to important questions about your business. No one likes asking people for money. You just have to suck it up and do it. Early Saturday, several members of our team were saying, “I’m not up for this. These people don’t want what we’re selling and I feel bad pushing it on them.” It was cool to see the transformation occur over time and by Sunday afternoon everyone was on their phone closing sales. Like anything - the more you do it, the more comfortable you get.<br/><br/>If you need a pump me up before doing some sales calls, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izOIOvguncU\" target=\"_blank\">watch this scene from Boiler Room<\/a>.  We would watch this whenever we felt ourselves losing steam.<br/><img height=\"242px;\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_B-pPssmafEAmPzhLVdhfp0CPoQSkKAvzh7Y8Gc3IDoZcXuOhog8DOEZ9HvIEd0gvYAyPhgCqqqLIgHP3eHEAPfgqGYQworPtnQA5MKqvQXDN43Lif491gOJjg\" width=\"323px;\"/><br/>above: our team in sales mode and about to hit the goal<br/><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Acquiring customers is ALL that matters - nothing else&hellip;not the website, not a logo, not a fancy demo. Props to Anthony Bosschem for figuring this and writing a cool post about it here - <a href=\"http://anthonybosschem.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/how-i-got-my-first-customers-without-having-a-product/\" target=\"_blank\">How I got my first customers without having a product<\/a>.<br/>Within the first hour, we had a <a href=\"http://awesomejerky.co\" target=\"_blank\">landing page<\/a> and paypal account setup.  It wasn’t the prettiest system ever, but it was enough. Our domain name didn’t even work until about 5 hours in so we were directing people to a long ugly github link.  We found errors with our paypal buttons all the way into the 30th hour. Who cares, what we had was enough to sell beef jerky delivery subscriptions. Everyone knows what beef jerky is, so all we were really doing was finding people that wanted more of it and wanted it delivered to their door.  <br/><br/>We had to resist the urge to do things like - offer free samples, come up with a cooler domain name, make a promo video, add extra descriptions to our website, or offer other product lines. One quick aside right here - before we started the weekend we weren’t certain if we wanted to sell beef jerky subscriptions or healthy snack box subscriptions (ie. naturebox). So, we decided that we’d focus on beef jerky, but also offer healthy snack boxes to people that don’t like beef jerky. We’re probably going to be kicking ourselves when we have to fulfill the snack box orders, but ultimately, it did help us reach the $1,000 mark.  We sold about 50 snack box subscriptions and the rest were beef jerky&hellip;out of our 262 total sales. <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol><p><br/><\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\"><li>\n<p>Your customer is not everyone - If they aren’t buying, move on. I spent over an hour on one potential customer, granted it was on FB chat, while working other leads, but he didn’t even buy. An entire hour and no sale! I spent another hour on a customer that did eventually buy a three month subscription, but quickly realized that wasn’t worth it.  Here’s the deal, if they aren’t interested, don’t waste your time. It’s not personal. Maybe they don’t like beef jerky, maybe they don’t have the money, maybe they just watched Fast &amp; Furious 6 and thought it would be better than the previous 5 and now they’re taking it out on you. Whatever it is, it doesn’t matter. Move on to someone that is interested. Another note on this - if your potential customer is having serious hesitations before buying, this is a good sign that they are going to be a high maintenance customer that you don’t even want.  <\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"4\"><li>\n<p>Determine what works and focus on it… this takes discipline.  <br/>We started off with low hanging fruit - close friends and family. Then we went to Facebook messaging people that were online, then gchat, then texting/phone calls, then Twitter. It was hard to measure what was working and even harder to focus on it once we determined it. It’s so easy to get distracted by that new friend that just signed onto Facebook when what you need to be doing is calling up the business owner that might buy 6 months for his office. Our team would run 1-2 hour sales sprints and then we’d regroup to see what was working.  After each sprint we would track our sales and see where they were coming from.  We kept a tight feedback loop.  <br/>We found out that Noah was right - real time communication wins.  90% of our sales came from real time communication, things like phone calls, texts, FB messages, gchat).<br/>The majority of our sales came from our own network. This is typical and can eventually become discouraging because you don’t think you can ever scale with this strategy… but just remember - Facebook started at Harvard with Mark Zuckerberg’s closest classmates first, then scaled after he proved and perfected the model with his early adopters. Everything works this way, so it’s ok if you aren’t closing lots of random people through Google Ad campaigns.<br/><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Success only happened because I had a rockstar Startup Weekend Team <br/><img height=\"251px;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oAHPxLrEWXaZrvOMxacZDQeMwRYskQdZpc--LzzRBrcqk_Gj8xc4A1SaiVne6VeLByheLlVwhBaVI5-2gEq2TkN1lN08P6Y8vzvOoeOg91tSK0TfKyChNeSBEA\" width=\"335px;\"/><br/><br/>I might have already said this, but Noah is a huge pimp for doing this alone and in 24 hours. Our team was stacked with awesome members that knew how to get stuff done… and quickly. A team of 8 took 44 hours to do what Noah did by himself in 24.  <br/>If I were to pick out the one thing that I did best for this initiative - it was putting together a rockstar team. This is something that I’ve become really good at over the last few years - attracting a solid team and then getting the most out of them. As a business owner and soccer coach, I’ve learned a lot over the last decade about recruiting and managing. I’ve created a whole course about it here (link to landing page for course). The team with the most best players always wins and thanks to my team, we succeeded this weekend.<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol><p><strong><strong><br/><br/><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here is a log file that I kept throughout the 44 hours (Friday 9 pm - Sunday 5 pm):<\/p>",

This young lady, Gabrielle, helped an older woman get something out from underneath her car in the Kroger parking lot. Then she walked into Kroger as if nothing happened. The best part about it was that she didn’t even think twice to help the woman. Here at 5spot, we believe that no act of kindness should go unnoticed, so we decided to do something about it. <\/p>\n<p><strong><strong><br/><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While she was walking to her car after grocery shopping, our very own David Booth surprised her with a warm greeting and handshake. David explained to Gabrielle that he had seen her help the elderly woman, and he then handed her a $50 Kroger gift card for her next trip to the grocery store.  Her surprised reaction was very genuine, expletives included. The lesson of the day is to be kind because no act of kindness is ever wasted, and you just might be rewarded for your kind deeds by a red bearded guy wearing an unbelievably soft t-shirt.<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong><br/><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>$5 from every shirt we sell at 5spot shirts is used to create a random act of kindness.

But what happens when you take that environment and add a lot more technology and more startups? You get San Francisco, and that’s exactly where former Awesome Inc team member Evan Leach is today.<\/p>\n\n<p>In a city full of culture and ideas, it’s easy to be at a coffee shop and “hear conversations about art and culture, or in different languages,” Evan said. Evan’s been granted a job at Eventbrite, the online ticketing service founded in San Francisco. Though he’s only been working there for a month, he said he’s learned a lot and explained the thrill of seeing immediate results, such as changing details on the site or mobile app and seeing results in the user experience and traffic.<\/p>\n\n<p>“It’s very metrics driven,” he said. “You really get to see actions with results faster than a startup, where it instead works in very incremental changes.”<\/p>\n\n<p>Being at Eventbrite has exceeded his expectations and proven to be a great thing to happen to him because he’s never been able to work on such large and complex projects, “As a designer, I love big problems, so this job is perfect.”<\/p>\n\n<p>And even though he shared his awe of San Francisco and the eager technology buzz, he attributes all of his values and knowledge to where it started for him: Awesome Inc. When asked about the most important thing he found at Awesome Inc, without a pause, he answered that it was the people. He raved about the people and the environment at Awesome Inc, saying, “the people there are extremely driven, know what they want, are so hopeful and passionate: it’s infectious.”<\/p>\n\n<p>He stressed that the great guys that started Awesome Inc created an environment where people can thrive and do good things. “Put a bunch of talented people in a room, add those guys, and nothing but good can come out of it,” he said.<\/p>\n\n<p>One of the things that I was most fascinated with Evan was his optimism. He shared his experience in the app he created for baseball fans, Crowded &ndash; an app he and his team could have written off as a failure, but didn’t. I was amazed at his half-full glass that he shared about how he and his team looked at not reaching their goals as a positive thing.<\/p>\n\n<p>“We walked away from it with a lot of knowledge,” Evan said. “Even now, we’re all applying knowledge everyday that we learned from Crowded and using the tools that we were taught in that experience.”<\/p>\n\n<p>His most important piece of advice is to take risks and to know that, no matter what happens, it’ll pay off in the end. Most of the people he’s working with now aren’t starting career paths, but rather have been able to start businesses, fend for themselves, see the large scope for a company and become an efficient human being with that same risk-taking mindset.<\/p>\n\n<p>“Even if the risk you’re taking isn’t your end goal, it gives you a platform to build upon.” Evan said.<\/p>\n\n<p>Evan is a young guy with a (Event)brite future ahead of him. Though his professional path may take him many places, he emphasized that right now, his number one job is to learn. He laughed and said, “from the moment I get to work, I learn. And my rule is that I work and learn until my computer runs out of power. I’m just trying to absorb as much as I can.”<\/p>\n\n<p>When it comes to his long-term goals, Evan mentioned that he still had the “startup bug” that infiltrates the city of San Francisco. “I’m really enjoying what I’m doing right now.” he said. “Especially at my age, I want to be really good at what I do. So many exciting things are happening in my head right now; I’m learning how design and technology work with people. I hope to continue working, become more involved with startups, and take more risks. Really, I’m just going one step at a time.”<\/p>\n\n<p>And of course, here at Awesome Inc, being ‘awesome’ is a really big aspect of the thriving environment. On defining what awesome meant to him, Evan said that his definition is constantly changing, but the core of it is “taking initiative and executing what you think is best.” He related it to all aspects of his life and said that if he wants to be a friend, he wants to build a strong level of trust and help them out. “The same goes for a coworker,” he said. “I want to not only help people succeed, but execute it at a high degree as well.”<\/p>\n\n<p>Thinking upon it again, he made sure to emphasize that the core values that are established at Awesome Inc are what he still holds true today. He says he values his experience in Lexington and attributes a lot of where he is today to the things he learned there and the people who helped him.<\/p>\n\n<p>Evan is the kind of person that truly loves what he does and the life he’s living out, whether it be trying out the foods of San Francisco or becoming one of the “distinct tribes” of people who love what they’re doing. After speaking to Evan, I realized that he’s the perfect example of exemplifying everything Awesome Inc. strives to be. He’s living out his life to be good, be excellent, be a friend, and be him, which altogether, makes him a pretty awesome guy.<\/p>\n<p><em>By Meredith Scroggin <\/em><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-43286794-2a4e-3067-9132-1cbce94ea45d\"><br/><\/strong><\/p>",

On Wednesday, October 30th, PowerTech Energy took the prize for their product, a water treatment device that desalinates and purifies water. What makes this device unique is it does not remove water from salt and impurities like other processes with a membrane, but pulls salt and impurities from the water directly. This process is more energy efficient and can process water more quickly. PowerTech Energy was founded by Dr. James Landon, Dr. Kunlei Liu, and Dr. Cameron Lippert. The text vote winner for the event was <a href=\"http://scante.net\" target=\"_blank\">Scante<\/a>, founded by Jon Prescott and Tom Dichiaro.

Global Startup Youth brings together over 500 young men and women from over 100 countries (250 from Malaysia) for an ideas accelerator to turn ideas into business ventures to solve real world health, environment, education, and women&rsquo;s empowerment issues. The Malaysian Ministry of Finance, the US Department of State, Up Global, and several other sponsors made it possible for these youth to go on this all-expense paid trip. This event is very similar to Startup Weekend, but on a much larger scale. At the end of the event is the Global Entrepreneur Summit itself, which is a gathering of over 18,000 participants in a collaborative environment, with guest speakers from around the world. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" height=\"250px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33820f9b1e80890ac0e9e70663a74905/tumblr_inline_mw2yn4uqUP1spm8pc.jpg\"/><\/p>\n<p>Global Startup Youth brings in over 100 mentors from around the world to assist the participants in developing their products. Nick Such was invited to attend the event as one of the mentors. The team he mentored went on to win the event with an application called Milestone. Milestone is designed to compare a users’ career plan with the path that their selected role models took on their own personal paths to success, offering recommendations for improving the user’s future outlook.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" height=\"250px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/db83aabaf47f67d172278fdb19d227fd/tumblr_inline_mw2yokgtkz1spm8pc.jpg\"/><\/p>\n<p>David attended as a youth participant and was on the STFree team. Their application is a mobile app that helps to stop the spread of STD’s, mainly in developing countries. It allows people to anonymously notify past sexual partners (and their partners) that they are all at risk for an STD, and sends educational materials to those who also test positive. I had the chance to speak to David after returning. He said it was one of the most amazing experiences of his life. “Getting to work with people from over 100 different countries was incredible. My team itself was made up of ten people from nine different countries.”<\/p>\n\n<p><em>By Adam Chaffins<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Edited by Jake Tapia<\/em><\/p>",

Although I’d like to say I’m the most important addition to the team, there are two other people (one new and one not so new) that are going to play an integral role here at Awesome Inc. One of the new faces you may have seen around is Theresa Simcic.<\/p>\n<p>Theresa completed her undergrad studies at Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania then moved to Lexington in 2009 for grad school to pursue and hold master’s degrees in both Experimental Psychology and Public Policy. Aside from holding more degrees than most Team Alpha members, she’s helping to launch the new fellowship program while writing grants for Awesome Inc. The new fellowship program will be a revamped version of the previous accelerator program. When Theresa isn’t keeping Awesome Inc awesome, she likes to hike, play tennis, and hang out with her dog and “best bud” Dakotah.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"499\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbd1db3d1178decc6da68c76d9e14653/tumblr_inline_mvssq8Bdcl1spm8pc.jpg\"><img alt=\"Theresa and Dakotah\" height=\"185px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/84ed8abd748bae80e117b75ffc6b3cd1/tumblr_inline_pk0qcyAA5T1spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"499\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cbd1db3d1178decc6da68c76d9e14653/tumblr_inline_mvssq8Bdcl1spm8pc.jpg\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n\n<p>Garrett Ebel is probably a familiar face for the long time Awesome Incers, and he recently returned from the the corporate world in Atlanta. Now, he’s back with even more enthusiasm this time to manage the space and Team Alpha. Garrett’s currently the Director of Daily Activities and Director of Friendship, which basically means he has to be nice and tie your shoes for you every once in a while (not really). 5spot shirts is one of his current projects at Awesome Inc, which is a socially focused apparel brand that puts creating kindness as the main priority. Garrett graduated from the University of Kentucky’s Gatton College of Business with a degree in Business Management and Analytics and also holds an MBA. And if that wasn’t enough, Garrett plays on an indoor soccer team with Awesome Inc Founder, Brian Raney, salvages old barns, and works at a restaurant. He’s also learning how to flip houses… and babies according to his Facebook profile picture.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"680\" data-orig-width=\"680\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RX9B-LkrbqK2Rlwoj0IHaGOiuV4bR8Vq_-0RevkKo6ZRMYOHpZSPdCAh6AVY_MLNoSK8jZ5NzG8vydUK0LOFTVFvEMgSC5f3Zna8F5x8ZFETP-IBIW6f47byqg\"><img alt=\"Garrett Ebel\" height=\"185px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e08fe98c223820989639e5c92b9e7f5a/tumblr_inline_pk0qcz3JH51spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"185px;\" data-orig-height=\"680\" data-orig-width=\"680\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RX9B-LkrbqK2Rlwoj0IHaGOiuV4bR8Vq_-0RevkKo6ZRMYOHpZSPdCAh6AVY_MLNoSK8jZ5NzG8vydUK0LOFTVFvEMgSC5f3Zna8F5x8ZFETP-IBIW6f47byqg\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>Again, I’d like to say that I’m the most important addition to the team (you wouldn’t be reading this if it wasn’t for me) but Theresa and Garrett will play an even more important part in Awesome Inc’s future. Awesome Inc Founder, Brian Raney, had these good words to say about them, &quot;Adding Garrett and Theresa to the team was an easy decision for us.  Both of them embody our core values and fit the culture of Awesome Inc.  We&rsquo;re really excited to have them on board.&ldquo; We are definitely excited for what’s to come and if your shoes ever need tying, Garrett’s just one call away.<\/p>\n<p><em>By Jake Tapia<\/em><\/p>",

Founded by Michael Ward (CEO), Mac Glidewell (COO), and Ben Wilson (CTO) TagaPet offers electronic tags for pet owners to help locate their pets in the event of them getting lost. These tags utilize NFC, or Near Field Communication technology, which allows the tags to be scanned by placing them near a NFC capable smartphone. QR codes are also printed on the tags so they can be scanned by phones lacking NFC.<\/p>\n<p>After winning the Kentucky Idea State U Elevator Pitch Competition in 2012, completing Awesome Inc’s Accelerator program the following summer and launching their product in early 2013, TagaPet is now in Amsterdam for Startupbootcamp’s new accelerator program, <a href=\"http://www.startupbootcamp.org/programs/nfc-contactless.html\" target=\"_blank\">Near Field Communications &amp; Contactless Interactions<\/a>. TagaPet is one of ten companies selected to participate in this new accelerator designed around contactless interaction technology, and the only team selected from the United States. During the three month program, TagaPet and their peers will have access to over 500 mentors from around the globe, free coworking office space in the new Vodafone HQ and access to test labs, legal and fiscal advice, marketing support and a plethora of other services to help improve their products. At the conclusion of the program, the ten teams will pitch their products/startups to investors in Amsterdam. Awesome Inc is proud of the accomplishments TagaPet has made and we they learn a lot during this venture.<\/p>\n<p>TagaPet is also running an <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tagapet-using-technology-to-protect-your-pet\" target=\"_blank\">Indiegogo campaign<\/a>.

We would not be here without you guys! Awesome Inc brought us here and we really appreciate it.<\/p>\n<p>By appreciate, I mean thanks for making my life a roller coaster day in and day out.

For the unfamiliar, Techstars is a mentor-ship driven summer-long program in Boulder and Boston for entrepreneurs to accelerate their business. They select about 20 companies from all over the nation to participate in the program. About 500 apply. At the end of the program Techstars holds demo day. This is an opportunity for the companies to pitch to potential investors to raise their first round of funding, most of them succeed. <br/><br/>Luke and I attended demo day last year. This year seven entrepreneurs from Lexington attended. We watched the 10 teams pitch their ideas to hundreds of investors. All of the pitches were solid, but our top picks were <a href=\"http://nextbigsound.com/\" title=\"Next Big Soun\" target=\"_blank\">Next Big Sound<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.spryplanner.com/\" title=\"Spry Planner\" target=\"_blank\">Spry<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.reteltechnologies.com/\" title=\"Retel\" target=\"_blank\">Retel<\/a>, &amp; <a href=\"http://www.takecomics.com/\" title=\"Take Comics\" target=\"_blank\">Take Comics<\/a>. <br/><br/>Awesome Inc plans to do something similar to Techstars called the Awesome Inc Experience next summer. <br/><br/>While in Boulder we also attended a few social media gatherings, visited the Techstars facilities, climbed a mountain, and did the thing in downtown Denver (just ask if you need to know). <br/><br/>It was a great trip and I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of Team Awesome. The seven of us that went on the trip and all the team members and supporters that we have in Lexington are a part of something big - something big that is changing the dynamics of the region and positively affecting the community and individuals. Thanks to everyone for their support. And thanks to Techstars for showing us what we have to shoot for.<\/p>"

Gazing around the <a href=\"http://www.commongroundsoflexington.com/\" target=\"_blank\">coffee house<\/a> currently sheltering me from heat-induced migraines and an endless battle with perspiration, I&rsquo;ve become quite fascinated with each of the faces illuminated by laptop screens and smart phones. Essentially the entire customer base is bridged to the outside world by a technological medium, and each of us is vigorously using our respective bridge for some unique (or <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">not s<\/a><a href=\"http://twitter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">o unique<\/a>) purpose. While some may consider this accessibility a plague to humanity, those of us that cradle our electronic devices like newborn children have learned to appreciate the possibilities presented by the rapid advancements in technology seen throughout recent years. In order to keep the innovation flowing, it&rsquo;s imperative that brilliant, new ideas be nurtured and given the opportunity to flourish. Last week, the<a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc.<\/a> team traveled to Boulder, Colorado to learn more about an organization that is doing just that.<\/p>\n<p>From the TechStars <a href=\"http://www.techstars.org/\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;TechStars is a mentorship-driven seed stage investment fund. Each year we run a summer-long program in Boulder, Colorado and Cambridge, Massachusetts. We&rsquo;re very selective - each year hundreds of companies apply to the program and we only take about ten per city. These companies get up to $18,000 in seed funding, a summer of intensive top-notch mentorship, and the chance to pitch to angel investors and venture capitalists at the end of the summer&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><span>In summary, TechStars accepts twenty companies out of roughly five-hundred applicants and provides those companies with <\/span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_money\" target=\"_blank\">seed funding<\/a> and mentorship during a three-month summer bootcamp. After an intensive preparation, each company pitches its idea to investors and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital\" target=\"_blank\">venture capitalists<\/a> in an attempt to raise the funding necessary to make its aspirations a reality. In past years, the organization has aided projects like<a href=\"http://intensedebate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IntenseDebate<\/a>, <a href=\"http://socialthing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Socialthing!<\/a>, <a href=\"http://brightkite.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brightkite<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.dailyburn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gyminee<\/a> obtain the knowledge and resources necessary to take their projects to the level that they are at today. We had the pleasure of sitting through this year&rsquo;s pitch day to see some of the up-and-coming projects designed to take the world by storm. Here is the list of companies that presented. <a href=\"http://www.reteltechnologies.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>ReTel Technologies<\/a> helps stores and restaurants optimize their operations and customer experiece. ReTel&rsquo;s system analyzes in-store security camera feeds to uncover, analyze, and report on metrics and trends that directly impact the bottom line. <a href=\"http://www.everlater.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>Everlater<\/a> makes it simple to document and remember travel experiences in a beautiful format. We enable easy sharing with family and friends by connecting to all major social networks and printing scrapbooks, postcards, and photo albums. Finally, we connect people with better travel ideas and information through exploring friends travel experiences. <a href=\"http://www.timzon.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>TimZon<\/a> is the easiest way to share visual feedback. By combining audio, video, whiteboard and screen capture it enables companies to establish high quality engagement with their customers while lowering support costs. <a href=\"http://www.takepublishing.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>Take Comics<\/a> is an end to end solution aiming to bring comics into the digital age just like iTunes has done for music and video. Take Comics creates pixel perfect content on a range of devices with focus on profitability for the publishers and readability for the users. <a href=\"http://thenextbigsound.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>Next Big Sound<\/a> measures the growth and popularity of bands across the major web properties and sells actionable insights around tat data to band managers and industry professionals. <a href=\"http://www.vanillaforums.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>Vanilla<\/a> is open source forum software that is used to power discussions on more than 300,000 sites across the web today. With the releases of the new and improved Vanilla 2, we will now be offering a hosted solution as well. <a href=\"http://www.sendgrid.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>Send Grid<\/a> is an email service that solves the problems faced by companies sending transactonal outbound email. Simply by using Send Grid instead of their current outbound email servers, companies experience greatly improved deliverability and scaliability while cutting costs and saving time. <a href=\"http://www.spryplanner.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>Spry<\/a> is insight into software projects. By monitoring all the tools and services used to develop software and analyzing the data in real-time, Spry enables clear and consistent communication throughout the team. This helps managers and developers make better decisions throughout the process thereby reducing the likelihood of failure and delay. <a href=\"http://www.mailana.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>Mailana<\/a> brings your real social network to life - the people you communicate with on a regular basis. By understanding your strong relationships across multiple communication channels, Mailana lets you share what realy matters with the people who really matter. <a href=\"http://www.rezora.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><br/>Rezora<\/a> is the only Software-as-a-Service email marketing platform specifically designed for the real estate industry. We enable brokerages and their agents to focus their expertise on what they do best: helping their consumers buy and sell real estate. Out of those ideas presented, my favorites were <a href=\"http://thenextbigsound.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Next Big Sound<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.takecomics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Take Comics<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.spryplanner.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Spry<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.reteltechnologies.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ReTel<\/a>, but I find each of the ten to be highly useful to its targeted audience. I hope to see each of these projects thrive within the next few years and pave the way for future innovations. Keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing, TechStars! The world needs <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">more organizations like you<\/a>! Stay tuned for the second part of the recap detailing everything that I learned from this experience and Boulder, in general!<\/p>"

No matter how much time you spend talking about how great it is going to be and the benefits for every one in the world, the brand still has to launch. I attend a church locally where my lead pastor has said we are in the year of the jump, meaning our church is going to grow fast with a new building addition.  So a friend of mine (NateFX) and I followed that lead and coined the term jump off for launching a brand with a tag line of might as well jump (set to the Van Hallen song of the same name). <\/p>\n<p><br/>Nate and I came up with that on a phone call at about 10 pm in the middle of March and are now launching our first brand together.  Through launching this brand we are actually launching a new business idea.  This means there is beta testing and all the rest. It is a real fun time and a great time of anticipation for the success of this brand and business. <br/><br/>Take a look at this video page and see what a brand is doing with nothing but volunteers on the team and a paid person leading the charge.  Anything can be done if you take a leap of faith&hellip;. might as well jump. :-) <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/qpza\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.vimeo.com/qpza<\/a> <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.vimeo.com/qcc\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.vimeo.com/qcc<\/a><\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>Last Wednesday, Awesome Inc attended the second Forge Lexington event at Silvacola Farm, hosted by Lyle Hannah and his wife. For those who are not familiar with Forge Lexington, it is a networking event designed to bring together investors and entrepreneurs in the Lexington area.<\/p>\n<p>The Silvacola Farm provided a nice relaxed setting to enjoy cocktails, excellent food, and priceless networking time with some of the most accomplished and esteemed individuals in the Bluegrass. The Forge community is represented by a wide diversity of individuals ranging from first time business owners to seasoned professionals.<br/><br/>Networking and great food aside, Forge invites a guest speaker to each event to give a brief talk about their achievements in business. For this event, Drew Curtis the founder of <a href=\"http://www.fark.com/\" target=\"blank\">Fark.com<\/a> was invited to speak. Curtis is the author of the Amazon bestseller, It&rsquo;s<em> Not News, It&rsquo;s FARK: How Mass Media Tries to Pass off Crap as News.<\/em> <br/><br/>Fark.com is a news aggregator and an edited social networking news site. According to the site, it receives 2,000 or so news submissions daily from its readership. The site was the first indieblogs to earn one million dollars a year in profit. Curtis has been featured in <em>Business 2.0<\/em> and similar publications highlighting his success and accomplishments. <br/><br/>Despite the huge success of Fark.com, Curtis to this day lives and runs his business from Lexington, Ky. Curtis explained the cost benefit of living and working in Lexington versus relocating to the Valley or similar communities. Drew explained the importance of the community and its relaxed culture that surrounds business startups. He talked about the absence of this notion to &ldquo;hurry up and fail&rdquo; so that you can move on to your next venture. The culture in the Bluegrass allows you to take your time and grow your business at a much more relaxed pace. <br/><br/>Curtis went on to explain that Lexington really isn&rsquo;t as disconnected as people claim. If he were to receive a call at 7:30 one evening he could realistically be on the West Coast by the next morning for a meeting. The low cost of living in Lexington allows him to expand at a much greater rate for significantly less money. <br/><br/>Overall, one can conclude that the Bluegrass is a great place to start and maintain a business. The low cost of living and demand for innovative jobs allow entrepreneurs to expand their businesses and prosper much quicker than in most other regions of the country. <br/><br/>Forge Lexington truly is a unique gathering of entrepreneurs, investors, innovators, thought leaders and supporters of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. I urge any entrepreneurs or investors reading this blog to attend the next Forge event to discover its true value and worth.<\/p>"

      "regular-title": "A Letter to the People of Columbus, OH",
      "regular-body": "<p>By Luke Murray<\/p>\n<p><br/>Dear Members of the Hi Tech, Creative, and Entrepreneurial Communities of Columbus, <br/><br/>I visited your fine city a couple weeks ago in order to attend an <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/techlifecolumbus/calendar/11023453/\" target=\"_blank\">Innovation Series Event<\/a> put on by <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/techlifecolumbus/members/7937093/\" target=\"_blank\">Ben <\/a>&amp;<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/techlifecolumbus/members/7950962/\" target=\"_blank\">Sandy<\/a> Blanquera about <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/techlifecolumbus/calendar/11023453/\" target=\"_blank\">Local iPhone and Mobile Innovation &amp; Development<\/a> .  I&rsquo;m planning on bringing a<a href=\"http://www.mobile.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">mobile phone technology conference<\/a> to Columbus in January, so this seemed the perfect opportunity to meet the folks in the community that would know the most about this scene.  Being that I own a <a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">collaborative workspace<\/a> for engineers, artists, and entrepreneurs I also wanted to see what I could learn about those in your city that live at this intersection of technology, creativity, and startups.  Often we become so accustomed to our own environments that we don&rsquo;t realize and appreciate their unique and admirable qualities.  I&rsquo;ve written this letter to remind you of these quirks and qualities of your great community. <br/><br/><\/p>\n<p>The &lsquo;hotspots&rsquo; of entrepreneurship in your community are simultaneously isolated and integrated.  When I first arrived at the Dublin Entrepreneur Center (the <a href=\"http://www.dublink.net/\" target=\"_blank\">DEC<\/a>) I was surprised at how little there was surrounding it.  It wasn&rsquo;t on or near a commercialized strip or even restaurants.  At first this struck me as a particularly undesirable thing (since my organization - which is my only frame of reference - is on Main Street in downtown Lexington), but as I walked through the space and met some of the thriving companies inside, it began to make much more sense.<\/p>\n<p>Parking was plentiful and not crowded, the lack of 'distractions&rsquo; surrounding the building set it apart as a place where you come to do value-creating work, and the space inside allowed companies to move grow much more easily than if they were having to jump from one office to another around downtown. <br/><br/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.avitae45.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Avitae<\/a>, a startup that makes caffeinated water, took advantage of this exact situation and slowly expanded its operation one office at a time on the 4th floor until they had outgrown the remaining space on that floor and had to move&hellip;down to the 3rd floor.  How convenient!<\/p>\n<p><br/><br/>At the same time, despite this apparent 'isolation&rsquo; when I walked inside the DEC there were people in your community working together openly and connecting with each other.  I had no trouble meeting people, as many of them were coming up to introduce themselves to me (Kevin Dwinnell of <a href=\"http://brandthunder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Brand Thunder<\/a> introduced himself to me right off the elevator)!  Also, I quickly found out that not only were they physically connected in how everyone seemed to know everyone, they were also incredibly networked digitally.  Super connectors like both Ben (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/BBlanquera\" target=\"_blank\">@bblanquera<\/a>) &amp; Sandy (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/sblanquera\" target=\"_blank\">@sblanquera<\/a>) Blanquera, as well as Rocky Vanbrimmer (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/sblanquera\" target=\"_blank\">@rockson<\/a>), Jody Dzuranin (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/JodynColumbus\" target=\"_blank\">@jodyncolumbus<\/a>), and Jon Myers (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/JonMyers\" target=\"_blank\">@jonmyers<\/a>) are all connected via social media and seem to really be able to pull together a social gathering of any kind.  Also, the physical layout of the community is connected to each other as well. I visited the <a href=\"http://www.techcolumbus.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TechColumbus<\/a> incubator and the coworking spaces in the area and they all seemed to be right in the heart of the action. <br/><br/><\/p>\n<p>The city is really supportive of what&rsquo;s going on financially and logistically. <a href=\"http://www.willieneumann.com/Custom/custom.asp?cmid=4587&amp;id=1048\" target=\"_blank\">Willie Neumann&rsquo;s<\/a> <a href=\"http://www.14ninetytwo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">14ninetytwo<\/a>program (a <a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ycombinator<\/a>-esque bootcamp/investment fund for entrepreneurs in the mobile and/or web space) is being supported on all levels by local government and community members. At the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/techlifecolumbus/calendar/11023453/\" target=\"_blank\">event <\/a>he talked about 14NinetyTwo's <a href=\"http://www.14ninetytwo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Weekend of Discovery <\/a>that was scheduled to begin the next day and it sounded like he had put together a great program.<\/p>\n<p><br/> <br/>Your community is thriving, both in size and energy. The DEC is HUGE!  The number of companies in there, the average size of companies, etc. are all impressive.  Also, the number of places that house these communities is much larger than I realized. As I mentioned, I stopped by TechColumbus and all three coworking spaces in town on my visit.  I spent a  considerable amount of time at <a href=\"http://www.sandboxcolumbus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sandbox <\/a>with David Hunegnaw (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/Hunegnaw\" target=\"_blank\">@hunegnaw<\/a>) and Tina Goodman (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/tinagoodman\" target=\"_blank\">@tinagoodman<\/a>) and was really impressed by their enthusiasm and genuine care for the creative and entrepreneurial community of Columbus as a whole (not just of their specific coworking space). <br/><br/>I also stopped by <a href=\"http://www.indiehousecollective.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Indiehouse<\/a> and <a href=\"http://qwirkcolumbus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Qwirk <\/a>to see how they were setup.  Everyone was very welcoming and it seems like the coworking 'environment&rsquo; on a whole is rapidly trending upwards, as each shop has similar stories and timelines of growth. <br/><br/><\/p>\n<p>The energy of your city also shows itself in the turnouts it has for its events. Jon Myers's <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mynameispaul/sets/72157622060104958/\" target=\"_blank\">launch party<\/a> for his<a href=\"http://www.jufti.com/\" target=\"_blank\">his company&rsquo;s<\/a> first iPhone app <a href=\"http://www.cornholeallstars.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cornhole Allstars<\/a> was well attended, and both <a href=\"http://columbus.startupweekend.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Columbus Startup Weekend<\/a> events had some of the highest turnouts I&rsquo;ve ever heard. Hats off to all the people that have contributed to and been a part of this growing, welcoming, and energetic community. A special thanks to Ben and Sandy Blanquera, &amp; Rick Copland for their help in making sure I was able to get as thorough picture of the Columbus technological, creative, and startup communities in 24 short hours!<\/p>\n<p>- Luke Murray, <a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc.<\/a> <br/><br/><a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/information/awesome-inc-rules/\" target=\"_blank\">Rule #17<\/a> Bring the fun. <br/><br/>P.S.  A blog summary of the Local iPhone and Mobile Innovation &amp; Development event, as well as a video interview of Jon Myers, Adam Winter (<a href=\"http://joemetric.com/JoeMetric/JoeMetric.html\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Metric<\/a> - great idea, btw), and myself can be found here courtesy of Sandy.  <a href=\"http://columbustech.blogspot.com/2009/08/local-iphone-innovation-cornhole.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://columbustech.blogspot.com/2009/08/local-iphone-innovation-cornhole.html<\/a><\/p>"

      "regular-title": "Lessons From the First \"Invention Saturday\"",
      "regular-body": "<p>Last Saturday Awesome Labs had their first official event in conjunction with the <a href=\"http://www.ckic.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Central Kentucky Inventors Council<\/a> and<a href=\"http://www.newtonsattic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Newton&rsquo;s Attic<\/a> called &ldquo;Invention Saturday&rdquo;. The idea was to build a <a href=\"http://www.break.com/index/best_rube_goldberg_ever.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rube Goldberg machine<\/a> in a single day, and it had its genesis from the concept of <a href=\"http://www.break.com/index/best_rube_goldberg_ever.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Startup<\/span> Weekend<\/a>, where a group of people get together and start a business in the course of a weekend. A little over a dozen people showed up on Saturday morning, ranging in age from 18 to 80 and after a breakfast of <span>Dunkin<\/span> Donuts, we got to work coming up with what the machine would do and the overly complex series of steps necessary to get it to accomplish this task. Eight hours later we were able to open a door and after six or seven crazy steps, turn on a light bulb. I learned a lot about physics and mechanical engineering that day but I also learned three important things about making ideas into a reality - whether it&rsquo;s a business, a Rube Goldberg machine, or a ground vehicle aerodynamic-enhancing truck modification (another current Awesome Labs project).<\/p>\n\n<p>When it&rsquo;s low cost &amp; low risk, pull the trigger before you&rsquo;re &ldquo;ready&rdquo;. Brandon, one of the UK engineering students that participated in I.S. found some steel cage material and a ball and had the idea of putting in a 3-dimensional &lsquo;kerplunk&rsquo; type apparatus similar to The Price Is Right game show. With those 2 objects he decided that was what he would build, and so he just started building. If he would have waited and planned out exactly all the materials he needed, he never would have finished it by the end of the day, because the way it had to interface with all the other things around it had not been determined yet (what would be directly before it? what would follow?). He had to continually adapt to what he was doing in order to make it fit everything around him. The same is true of any idea. Start working on it now and be ready to change the peripheral details about how you get it done&hellip;because those are always in flux.<\/p>\n\n<p>Getting simple things done consistently is hard. Christopher and Andrew, two other UK students had a very simple idea: have a cylinder swing and knock a hammer backwards, and then have that hammer knock a ball over as it swung forwards again. Seems really easy, but getting this right took A LOT of tinkering, and if it didn&rsquo;t work it killed the whole machine right away&hellip;as it was one of the first steps. The lesson here is don&rsquo;t procrastinate on the 'simple&rsquo; parts of your idea because you think they&rsquo;ll be easy and take no time. Odds are it will end up being much more difficult than you think. Old people + Young people = Awesome people. There is a lot of talk about how important diversity is and for the most part I disagree with it because when it&rsquo;s implemented, it is usually diversity for diversity&rsquo;s sake. However, when everyone is excited about working towards a common goal together, having a range of ages and experiences really comes out in how well things get done and the opportunity for teaching that goes on. Bill <span>Cloyd<\/span>, owner of<a href=\"http://www.newtonsattic.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> Newton&rsquo;s Attic<\/a> (a company that offers interesting educational experiences&hellip;like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY0KQvMKvV4\" target=\"_blank\">this one<\/a>) was able to offer help and ideas to some of the engineering students there and the students were really glad to be surrounded by professional engineers, inventors, physicists, etc. The give and take was very apparent&hellip;not only in the moral but in the results.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, in eight hours we pulled it off and made something really easy into something really complicated&hellip;but we also managed to learn the importance of an itchy trigger finger, the complexity of simplicity, and the importance of team diversity when trying to do something Awesome!<\/p>"

      "regular-title": "The Idea Festival - What It's ACTUALLY About",
      "regular-body": "<p>For three days every year, some of the most brilliant innovators in the world converge in Louisville, KY to attend The <a href=\"http://www.ideafestival.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Idea Festival<\/a> - a <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TED<\/a>-esque conference that comes in the form of a series of lectures and performances by leaders in all areas of left and/or right-brained professions. I decided to join them this year to answer one seemingly simple question: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;<br/><br/><br/><br/>Unfortunately, I found out very quickly that &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; was actually one of the most complex questions I could have asked. Each person I spoke to had a different answer. Some were from the University of Kentucky<a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/OtherOrgs/GainesCenter/current_fellows.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gaines Fellowship Program<\/a> or the UK <a href=\"http://www.uky.edu/Provost/ChellgrenCenter/fellows.htm#eight\" target=\"_blank\">Chellgren Undergraduate Fellows Program<\/a>. Some of these students were simply there to broaden their perspective, while others had specific interests in a certain lecture as they pertained to research they were doing. The <a href=\"http://louisville.edu/medschool/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Louisville School of Medicine<\/a> had several students attend as well. Some were attending as musicians interested in hearing <a href=\"http://www.ideafestival.com/Dynamic/Speakers/Show_Bio.cfm?ID=12208\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Kogan<\/a> - a world-renowned psychiatrist and pianist. Others were attending as clinicians hoping for a balanced life, wanting to hear how Dr. Kogan has successfully pulled off juggling two careers. The list, of course, goes on. There were several hundred people in attendance&hellip;I only got to ask thirty or so&hellip;<br/><br/><br/><br/>&hellip;But then there&rsquo;s the event organizers themselves. Kris Kimel of the <a href=\"http://www.kstc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kentucky Science &amp; Technology Corporation<\/a>, the conference&rsquo;s organizer, often answers this &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; question with answers like: &ldquo;to share ideas&rdquo;, &ldquo;to make ideas open and available to people&rdquo;, &ldquo;to make ideas open source&rdquo;. Hmm&hellip;no attendees talked like this?<br/><br/><br/><br/>At first glance it sounded like the reason people came to the conference and the reason the conference was put on were different.  This is not unusual. Oftentimes people come together to make a transaction for completely different reasons. We go to McDonald&rsquo;s to buy a hamburger because we&rsquo;re hungry. The people that work at McDonald&rsquo;s are there to make you a hamburger because they want to make money - nothing wrong with that&hellip;because everyone ultimately gets what they want. However, in this case I found that the desires of the organizers and the attendees ultimately did come together if you asked &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and listened long enough.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why do the organizers put it on? So that people can share unique realizations (i.e. Dr. Kogan sharing his discovery that Tchaikovsky was most likely clinically depressed through studying his letters, journals, and music)&hellip;or not so unique realizations but from a unique perspective (i.e. <a href=\"http://www.ajjacobs.com/content/home.asp\" target=\"_blank\">A.J. Jacobs<\/a> learning about the importance of focus by Unitasking for four months). Why do they want to do this? So that others can hear about them. Why do they want others to hear about them? Well that&rsquo;s where the desires of the organizers meet the motives of its attendees.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Idea Festival is not about ideas.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Why do people show up? It&rsquo;s not simply to be exposed to a new thought, something they&rsquo;ve never considered before. Yes, it&rsquo;s interesting to know that possums have 13 nipples (thanks Mr. Jacobs) but having this piece of knowledge shared with me isn&rsquo;t why Kris Kimel and his wonderful staff spend all year preparing for this event. The point of the Idea Festival is to create <strong>inspired<\/strong> <strong>ideas<\/strong>, that do teach us something but ultimately will<strong>change our behavior<\/strong> in a way that benefits the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dr. Kogan played the piano beautifully and I was thoroughly interested in his stories about Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s personal, professional, and mental life, but what I ultimately took from his playing and his presentation is the realization and the intention that I too can choose to inspire, educate, and entertain the world in ways that &ldquo;fit&rdquo; my interests and talents - no matter how unique. Mr. Jacobs gave me the idea AND the inspiration to spend a month living with my grandparents, something I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do but thought was too &lsquo;crazy&rsquo; of an idea to try. After hearing about his experiences with living biblically for a year, reading the whole Encyclopedia Britannica, and becoming a woman - taking some time &ldquo;off&rdquo; with no other purpose but to learn didn&rsquo;t sound nearly as impossible or unreasonable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>An Idea doesn&rsquo;t make the world a better place and everyone that attends or puts on the Idea Festival knows that. But an idea coming from a person that embodies its principles can ultimately catalyze someone to take action on it in a way that motivates them to change their world. That&rsquo;s what the Idea Festival is ACTUALLY about. Unfortunately for me, the &ldquo;Inspired Ideas Festival&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have nearly as nice of a ring to it ;)<\/p>"

      "regular-title": "Start a Business With 100+ People In 3 Days...",
      "regular-body": "<p>Last month I went to up to UC for a couple days to start a company. Yes&hellip;start a company in a few days&hellip;a weekend to be exact.  Apparently, I&rsquo;m not the only person crazy enough to do this - there were 100+ other people there that planned on doing the same thing.  And, just to clear up some confusion: - No - We didn&rsquo;t know each other - No - We didn&rsquo;t know how we were going to make money - No - We didn&rsquo;t have a business plan - No - WE DIDN&rsquo;T EVEN KNOW WHAT BUSINESS WE WERE GOING TO START<\/p>\n<p>The only thing we all knew is that we were sure we&rsquo;d have something by the end of the day on Sunday.  Fortunately, Elizabeth Edwards (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/eedwards\" target=\"_blank\">@eedwards<\/a>), <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bill-cunningham/5/522/6b0\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Cunningham<\/a>, Steve Boord, and <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jeffrey-stamp/4/946/609\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Jeff Stamp<\/a> had done this before last year.  It was the second annual <a href=\"http://inoneweekend.org/\" target=\"_blank\">InOneWeekend<\/a> event.<\/p>\n\n<p>So how do you go about getting 100 people to make something from nothing in two and a half days?  Well, I don&rsquo;t really know for sure, but I did learn this:<\/p>\n<p>- Organized chaos is unavoidable and necessary.<br/><br/>I mean both words. Organized AND chaos. Jeff and Elizabeth had a &ldquo;plan&rdquo; throughout the weekend. It started with teaching, and then ideation, and then consistent updates on the project&rsquo;s progress. All weekend long we were trying to hit benchmarks and timelines. However, Jeff was careful not to make the decisions himself or to force us to do anything specific&hellip;which meant we spent A LOT of time not having a clue what we were going to do. I probably heard &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re doing&rdquo; about 1,428 times. The good part is that this confusion and lack of complete clarity didn&rsquo;t keep people from participating. The participation, of course added to the confusion and the chaos (if you add 100 people&rsquo;s two cents up, you&rsquo;ve got more than pocket change&hellip;and a lot of pennies to count) but it ended up creating a REALLY well thought through idea. No angle hadn&rsquo;t been considered. So once we were able to go&hellip;we really took off, which made me realize&hellip;<br/><br/>- Deciding on what you are going to do is at least half the battle<br/><br/>We started thinking about ideas at around 6 or 7pm on Friday and still hadn&rsquo;t started &ldquo;working&rdquo; in the traditional sense over 24 hours later. We didn&rsquo;t even have a name until Saturday night. BUT once we did clarify what our idea was going to be (Dipidee - a last minute local deal finder for services - i.e. sporting events) we made an amazing amount of progress. The idea had been scrutinized and clarified so much that when all 100 people were cut loose to start working on it they knew exactly what they were working on. How far we got by Sunday was what really surprised me the most though&hellip;<br/><br/>- It&rsquo;s amazing what can happen when people set &ldquo;unrealistic&rdquo; goals<br/><br/>Yep, 100 people that didn&rsquo;t know each other or what they were going to do ultimately were able to put together thorough market research, financials, screen shots, basic back end functionality, a logo, and even a short commercial. It was impressive to say the least, and I really am glad that people like the folks at <a href=\"http://www.neyerholdings.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Neyer Holdings<\/a> are out there encouraging us to do something we wouldn&rsquo;t have thought possible if we were doing it all by ourselves&hellip;especially not in one weekend.<br/><br/>So sign up for <a href=\"http://www.dipidee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dipidee<\/a> to find out more about how this &ldquo;experiment turned company&rdquo; grows.<br/><br/>Dipidee - Jump on it!<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.dipidee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dipidee.com/<\/a><\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>By Luke Murray<\/p>\n<p>On Tuesday I went up to Cincinnati for one of the first <a href=\"http://www.cincycoworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cincy Coworks<\/a> day of coworking. I realized the strength and vibrancy of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky entrepreneurial culture a <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/2009/09/27/start-a-business-with-100-people-in-3-days/\" target=\"_blank\">few weeks ago<\/a> at <a href=\"http://www.inoneweekend.org/\" target=\"_blank\">In One Weekend<\/a>, but I hadn&rsquo;t seen a semi-permanent gathering of people getting together to do their own thing&hellip;until now. I ended up at <a href=\"http://venue222.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Venue 222<\/a> around noon, not knowing at all what I&rsquo;d find.<\/p>\n<p>I was quickly and pleasantly surprised to see art on the walls, a ping pong table upstairs, and a bunch of cool people doing awesome stuff. Here are just a few of them:<\/p>\n<p>Gerard Sychay &amp; Bill Barnett - These guys are the founders of Cincy Coworks - which right now is an occasional gathering of freelancers doing their own thing. Their &ldquo;mission as a professional community hub is to transform how people in Cincinnati with ideas get together and make the region a better place to live.&rdquo; I got to sit on some bean bags with them for awhile and talk about&hellip;you guessed it&hellip;.Awesome stuff! In this case that ended up being the visions we had for the things we were doing and why we were doing them. These guys are both trying to do something that will really benefit their community and they&rsquo;re doing it for the &lsquo;right&rsquo; reasons. Hats off fellas!<\/p>\n<p>Chris - After mentioning some of the things we&rsquo;re doing at <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/the-awesome-space/labs/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Labs<\/a>, Chris insisted that I check out a hackerspace close by called <a href=\"http://www.hive13.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Hive13<\/a>. Really cool looking place with some neat toys. Thanks for taking the time to drive me over there Chris!<\/p>\n<p>Everyone that ever worked at <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/www.zipscene.com\" target=\"_blank\">zipscene.com<\/a> - Actually I just met Colin. Gerard works there too, but I already told you about him ;)<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://kristaneher.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Krista<\/a> from <a href=\"http://bootcampmobile.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bootcamp Mobile<\/a> (among other things) - Krista and I had already met a few times before, so it was a pleasant surprise to get to see her again. We connected first while I was reaching out to local mobile experts for the <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/www.mobile.awesomeinc.org\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile miniConference<\/a> we had this summer, and then I got to hang out with her again at InOneWeekend.<\/p>\n<p>There were plenty more people there, and overall the event was a huge success and a great time. Thanks Gerard and Bill and keep up the good work. Just don&rsquo;t forget Rule #4 - Always do something awesome over something not awesome!<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>Inventors, idea people, and entrepreneurs converged in Lexington this evening for the 5<sup>th<\/sup> annual Inventors Conference hosted by the Central Kentucky Inventors Council (<a href=\"http://www.ckic.org/\" title=\"Central Kentucky Inventors Council\" target=\"_blank\">CKIC.org<\/a>). The team from Awesome Labs stopped by to talk to gather feedback on the Interactive Touch Screen and our upcoming Engineering Entrepreneurship program. The folks from the CKIC did an excellent job of bringing together a host of local innovators. They showcased products ranging from innovative pet housing, to solar powered jackets, our friend Ken's <a href=\"http://www.breathefreshair2.com/\" target=\"_blank\">novel air purification system<\/a>, Bill Cloyd&rsquo;s increasingly popular <a href=\"http://www.newtonsattic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Newton&rsquo;s Attic<\/a> program, and even the pre-collegiate stars of <a href=\"http://elements.pld.fcps.net/robotics/\" target=\"_blank\">PLD Robotics<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>The day began with an early morning at the <a href=\"http://www.lexpublib.org/central/\" target=\"_blank\">Lexington Central Library<\/a>. At 5:15am, about 15 exhibitors and CKIC members talked with <a href=\"http://www.leecruse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lee Cruse<\/a> from LEX18 to promote the evening&rsquo;s event. Everyone reconvened at 6pm, when Don Skaggs, President of the CKIC, kicked off the evening&rsquo;s festivities with a video showcasing inventors and an introduction to the theme Climate of Innovation. This led into presentations from Nick with the Lexington Public Library and Gordon Garrett from the <a href=\"http://www.ksbdc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Small Business Development Center<\/a>, culminating in the keynote address from <a href=\"http://www.louisforeman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Louis Foreman<\/a>, renowned inventor and entrepreneur.<\/p>\n<p>The conferences common thread, as eluded to by Climate of Innovation, is that the recession environment is a great time to start a technology-based business. While this bodes well for Awesome Labs on the surface level, this assertion comes with a few cautionary notes:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Problem before solution<\/strong>. If there is no need for your product, you won&rsquo;t succeed. Utilize free resources (like libraries, biz dev centers) for this research.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Revenue must exceed expenses.<\/strong> You will not survive if this fails.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Tailor your product to your customers.<\/strong> This means you must take the time to get to know your customers, and that you need to find a way for your customers to get to know your product.<\/p>\n<p>While these are undoubtedly not original thoughts on the innovation commercialization process, it was helpful to have them laid out again. We inventors tend to fall in love with our ideas, while ignoring all the free resources we have available. The best (read: my favorite) advice of the night came via a video featuring the innovation manager from WD-40: failure is good. Accepting that one idea has failed means that you have gotten one step closer to success. It is far worse to deny failure, and attempt to follow through with a lousy idea.<\/p>\n<p>So, here&rsquo;s to failure, early and often, in the pursuit of Awesomeness.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>By Brian Raney<\/p>\n<p><br/><br/><a href=\"http://lexington.startupweekend.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Weekend<\/a> is coming to Lexington for the 2nd year in a row on Nov 20-22, 2009. Startup Weekend is a 54 hour startup event that provides networking, resources, and incentives for individuals and teams to go from idea to launch. It is all about building community, starting companies and ultimately following <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/rules\" target=\"_blank\">rule #22<\/a>: go big or don&rsquo;t be my friend. Everyone who attends Startup Weekend goes big in the sense that they commit to making strides towards turning their idea into a company in less than three days. The event is intentionally limited in structure to allow for participants to spend most of their time doing work. The primary purpose of Startup Weekend is to DO SOMETHING. Spend very little time talking about your idea and most of the time doing something toward launching your idea. <br/><br/>There are two major benefits to attending Startup Weekend. First is the networking opportunity - You will meet local developers, innovators, business leaders, and entrepreneurs. Over the course of the three day event, meaningful relationships are built and valuable connections are made. The second benefit is to harness the power of community. We expect about 75 participants to attend Startup Weekend this year. So instead of working on your latest ground-breaking idea in the basement of your house, join a bunch of other like-minded individuals at Startup Weekend. For the same reason that people are more motivated while working out at a gym, participants at Startup Weekend reap the benefits of working among a group of other motivated individuals. <br/><br/>Startup Weekend was started in 2007 by <a href=\"http://andrewhy.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Hyde<\/a>. The program has traveled to over 52 cities and 12 countries. The program is now run by Marc Nager and Clint Nelson out of Seattle, WA. This year&rsquo;s event in Lexington is part of Global Entrepreneurship week. Lexington is one of seven cities hosting a Startup Weekend during the weekend of Nov 20th.<\/p>\n<p><br/>  <br/>Last year&rsquo;s event had about 65 attendees and 8 companies were formed. One of those companies is called<a href=\"http://uvestor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Uvestor<\/a>. Led by John Williamson, Uvestor is a real estate communication platform where investors, real estate agents, brokers, and landlords can be connected instantly. Uvestor turned out to be such a success that John now runs the company full time. <br/><br/>Get more info at <a href=\"http://lexington.startupweekend.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://lexington.startupweekend.org<\/a> <br/><br/>Event Details Date/Time: Friday, Nov 20 6pm, Sunday, Nov 22 7pm Location: <a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc<\/a> @ 348 East Main Street, Lexington, KY 40507 Cost: $40, includes 7 meals and a t-shirt.

      "regular-body": "<p>That&rsquo;s right&hellip;six new innovation-driven Kentucky companies started by lunch. Not a bad morning&rsquo;s work. Ten additional entrepreneurs signed-up for vouchers to start their company within the next 90 days. <br/><br/>This was the outcome of a Start-up Slam held in Lexington on Friday, November 20th at Awesome Inc. Start-up Slams are a new experiment of the Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation (KSTC) and its partners, the Cabinet for Economic Development&rsquo;s Department of Commercialization and Innovation and the Council on Postsecondary Education as part of an ongoing strategy to build new entrepreneurial companies in the State. Slams bring together entrepreneurs and business professionals in a high-energy setting to learn, network and start innovation-driven companies. <br/><br/>A similar event was held in October in Louisville at the Louisville Science Center and one is scheduled for Northern Kentucky on March 19, 2010 at NKU&rsquo;s Center for Entrepreneurship. A potential 25 to 30 new companies could be started as a result of just the Louisville and Lexington events alone. Slams are now in the works for Eastern and Western Kentucky as well. <br/><br/>For additional information or to learn more about the Start-Up Slams, <a href=\"http://startupslam.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">click here<\/a> or contact Matt McGarvey at (859) 233-3502 ext. 240 or mmcgarvey at kstc.com.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>By Luke Murray<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"catcher-fail\" border=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://awesomeinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/catcher-fail.jpg\" width=\"150\"/><\/p>\n<p>Winners are the ones who fail. Failures are the ones who never play. First, the best podcasts on entrepreneurship are the ones found at Stanford&rsquo;s Entrepreneur Corner, or e-corner (<a href=\"http://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts.html<\/a>). Speakers for Stanford&rsquo;s Entrepreneur Seminar Series include such high profile people as Carly Fiorina (former HP CEO), Steve Balmer (Microsoft CEO), and Mark Zuckerberg (facebook founder &amp; CEO). However, one of the best talks I&rsquo;ve heard in this series (and I&rsquo;ve listened to at least half of the 100+ lectures) is by the director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program - Tina Seelig. She teaches entrepreneurship at Stanford and gave a talk on how to do this well.<\/p>\n<p>The part from the lecture that stuck out to me the most was how much she encouraged failure. The ratio of your successes to failures is probably going to stay the same, so the path to more successes is more failures. The same is true in so many other things in life - the salesman with the most sales has probably been told &lsquo;no&rsquo; the most, the baseball player with the most hits probably has the most strikeouts, the musician with the most hit singles probably has more &ldquo;dud&rdquo; songs than other musicians&hellip;and the person with the most successful company has probably had more failed companies and more failures within their current company than the person with the mediocre company.<\/p>\n<p>So, if failure is so important to success, then why don&rsquo;t people do it? The same reason they don&rsquo;t go skydiving or ride rollercoasters&hellip;the perception of danger. 99.99% of the time, going skydiving or riding in a rollercoaster will not kill you or even hurt you. But people see what could happen and this keeps them from doing it. To a much lesser degree, people don&rsquo;t embrace failure in life because of the perceived pain as well. Getting shot down by a girl at a bar doesn&rsquo;t actually physically harm you or put you in danger in any way. Neither does being rejected when selling a product, or putting together an event that nobody shows up to. It&rsquo;s just not worth the perceived danger or the damage to our egos or feelings.<\/p>\n<p>How do you fight this? How do you create a culture that embraces and celebrates failures? We don&rsquo;t know yet, but here at Awesome Inc. we must figure it out if we want to build a culture full of winners. This is what we&rsquo;ve done so far:<\/p>\n<p>- Go Big Friday - fail big every Friday. The risk must have a massive potential upside for you and a very high likelihood of failure. It must be at least somewhat relevant to your personal goals (i.e. contact the president of the most successful company in town and ask to meet with them). Twitter hashtag: #gobigfriday. Website: <a href=\"http://www.throughfailure.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.throughfailure.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>- The Failure Dashboard - a large whiteboard in the middle of our break room where you record your failure &amp; the lesson you learned from it. Awards will be given monthly for the largest failure and the highest number of failures each month. What ideas do you have that would help create a culture that encourages trying new things and embraces failure as a tool to reach success?<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>Andy Cox manages our art gallery, fixes up our art studio, and is just an all around handyman. He is great! Andy&rsquo;s most recent project was to install a &ldquo;Victory Bell&rdquo; - an idea we got from <a href=\"http://www.gray.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gray Construction<\/a> - a local construction company here in Lexington that rings a giant bell mounted near the roof of their building at the closing of each contract&hellip;one ring for every million dollars the contract was worth. We decided this idea was awesome&hellip;so we replicated it for ourselves and put it in the same room as our <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/2009/12/18/how-to-get-people-to-fail-more/\" target=\"_blank\">failure dashboard<\/a>. <br/><br/>  <br/><br/>Almost as important as <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/2009/12/18/how-to-get-people-to-fail-more/\" target=\"_blank\">encouraging failure<\/a> is rewarding &amp; celebrating success. Celebrating success is easy to do as long as you remember to do it. You don&rsquo;t have to mount a bell to a 4&quot;x4&quot;&hellip;just throw a party (or do whatever your company culture would consider &lsquo;fun&rsquo;). <br/><br/>Rewarding success, however, can be a little tougher because it typically requires more resources than taking an extended and festive break (aka. 'party&rsquo;). Since Awesome Inc. isn&rsquo;t flush with cash right now (or really any other resource besides great people like Andy) we have to get creative in the ways that we reward success. Luckily we have found that most of the people that help out around here are happy and self-motivated by the intrinsic reward of doing something they consider awesome&hellip;and they stay that way. Lots of this has to do with the fact that this place is already filled with happy people, but the other part (we&rsquo;d like to think) is that we&rsquo;ve consciously made sure that those that did good work and/or succeeded in their endeavors were appreciated. <br/><br/>There are several ways in which you can 'positively motivate&rsquo; people. In Jack Welch&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Winning&rdquo; he notes that the three main ways are: 1. Money 2. Training 3. Recognition/Reward. Some incentives (i.e. promotions) are a combination of both money and recognition. The more you are aware of what types of rewards motivate people, the more effective you can be with your resources to do so. <br/><br/><\/p>\n\n<p><br/><br/>As I look back on the tools we&rsquo;ve used to motivate people thus far, we really haven&rsquo;t used much of #1 or #2, and in the classic sense, we haven&rsquo;t done much with #3 either. I&rsquo;d like to say that the main reason we have yet to use these tools as motivators is because we don&rsquo;t have the money to, but the more I look at it, the more I realize that we haven&rsquo;t done a very significant step. One of the most important things that needs to be in place before we can start rewarding people via #1, #2, or #3, or ringing our victory bell is that we have to have clear metrics/measurements of their success. <br/><br/>At Gray Construction it&rsquo;s very simple: One ring for every million dollars of a closed contract. At Awesome Inc. each person is working on a different project (The Interactive Touchscreen in Labs, The Awesome Inc. Experience, The Awesome Space, events, and then you have the individual companies) and while each company has clear goals and milestones, we have yet to pick which ones are important enough to be celebrated or rewarded with a party, a bell ringing, or anything else. We need to define 'celebratable&rsquo; success for each department or project. Maybe we should only ring it for every million dollars we make as well? The point is we have to define which success should get celebrated before we can start throwing parties just yet. <br/><br/>Up to this point we have done a very good job with giving people recognition informally in weekly meetings, or giving small gifts or (and this is hands down the most important and most effective) being frequently and sincerely appreciative of people&rsquo;s help. But as we move forward, we need to crystallize our definition(s) of success so we can apply more principles of motivation to encourage it&hellip;and so do you, that is, if you expect to motivate your team towards awesomeness as well. <br/><br/>Just remember that when you do throw that party, follow rule #17&hellip; <br/><br/><\/p>\n\n<h1 id=\"\">&ldquo;Bring the Fun&rdquo;<\/h1>"

      "regular-body": "<p>By Brian Raney<\/p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t have interns at Awesome Inc. We have Team Alpha - a well oiled machine that knocks out to-do lists quicker than Muhammad Ali can knock out Sonny Liston. They tackle assignments better than Ray Lewis tackled opponents in his prime. They throw down projects with more authority than Lebron James. Unafraid of any task, from building sound proof rooms, to fixing ping pong tables, to dominating Google sketch-up, Team Alpha can and will do anything to make Awesome Inc more awesome. This semester&rsquo;s class is highly rated among startups nationwide. Allow me to introduce the Team Alpha Spring Class of 2010.<\/p>\n<p>Leading the way is Therese Henrickson. Therese is in her 2nd term and is the captain of team alpha. Some people say they&rsquo;ll take talent over experience any day. I say, give me both. Therese is an all star and will be responsible for three primary initiatives: 1. Managing the team 2. Awesome Space administration 3. Event Coordination<\/p>\n<p>Ashley Williams is our other returning team alpha member. Ashley was our utility player last semester and will be taking on a similar role this semester with a focus on: 1. Awesome Space administration 2. Online and Offline purchasing<\/p>\n<p>Coming in from the <a href=\"http://comm.uky.edu/?page=Internship+Program\" target=\"_blank\">University of Kentucky Department of Communication<\/a> is Bert Berry and Zach Magoto. Investors beware: this dynamic duo doesn&rsquo;t take no for an answer. Bert plans to focus his semester on the following: 1. Organizing the creation of the Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame 2. Marketing Events Meanwhile, Zach will be dominating these projects: 1. The creation of Awesome Media, the new media outlet for Awesome Inc 2. Awesome Space administration<\/p>\n<p>Another University of Kentucky undergrad, Garrett Ebel, comes in standing 6'2&quot; and weighing 175lbs. He was recruited to Team Alpha through <a href=\"http://lexington.startupweekend.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Weekend 09<\/a>. Garrett likes to play soccer, work with his hands, and enjoys long walks through the Awesome Space while listening to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMt8ZYaJKmA\" target=\"_blank\">#3<\/a>. Garrett has one goal for the start of his career at Awesome Inc victory over the garage and its team of junk, filth, and disorder.<\/p>\n<p>Two team members come from local high schools through a program called <a href=\"http://www.fcps.net/about-fcps/education-options/careertech/ebce\" target=\"_blank\">EBCE<\/a>. EBCE stands for Every Body Can Execute and so that&rsquo;s exactly what this crew does! Actually it stands for Experience Based Career Education but all that matters is that Matt Storrs and Desny Guerrier follow rule #22 &ldquo;go big or don&rsquo;t be my friend&rdquo;. Matt is spending his time on: 1. Entrepreneur Profile Wall showcasing our rockstars including the likes of Steve Jobs (<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\" target=\"blank\">Apple<\/a>), Larry Page and Sergey Brin (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/\" target=\"blank\">Google<\/a>), and Jack Welch (<a href=\"http://www.ge.com/\" target=\"blank\">GE<\/a>). 2. Graphics Design Desny has a niche focus on the arts and will be solely dedicated to making Awesome Inc more awesome looking by painting our logo all over the place and designing a giant mural for the art studio.<\/p>\n<p>Our ace in the hole this semester is David McGee. David tweets like his life depends on it. Our online reputation lies in the hands of this young social media expert. His primary focus will be Awesome Inc&rsquo;s online presence, more specifically: 1. Online Social Media for Awesome Inc&rsquo;s twitter, facebook, etc 2. Website Content 3. Building Community<\/p>\n<p>No team is complete without a video highlights reel. That is where Walker Miller, Henry Clay High School senior, comes into play. Walker can simultaneously record a shoot, mix a soundtrack, and render transitions, all while making himself a sandwich. Walker&rsquo;s primary focus this semester is to develop Awesome Inc&rsquo;s video presence into something that Paramount Pictures will be begging to acquire within the calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>Rounding up team alpha are three big names, two more from the University of Kentucky, Hilary Perrine, recent grad and Josh Strange, computer science genius and one from East Jessamine High, Madeline Knoblett. Hilary, Josh, and Madeline are focusing on the <a href=\"http://www.mobilexconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\">mobileX conference<\/a> series and assisting with marketing, planning, and website development. They don&rsquo;t let the fact that no one has ever pulled off five mobile conferences in a two month span in various cities throughout the Midwest before even phase them. They just execute. Period.<\/p>\n<p>We have a don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell policy at Awesome Inc, don&rsquo;t ask for extensions and don&rsquo;t tell me any excuses. Its business 101, keep a low FF (flakey factor) and a low SS (crap to substance ratio). It all goes back to rules<a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/rules\" target='_blank\"'>#21<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/rules\" target='_blank\"'>#76<\/a>. So if you&rsquo;re part of team alpha, that means you&rsquo;re launching a series of conferences, building a media conglomerate, inventing a hall of fame, or doing something else equally as Awesome. If you have the guts to follow <a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/rules\" target='_blank\"'>rule #22<\/a> and are interested in being part of the team, we&rsquo;re accepting applications at:<a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/information/team-alpha/\" target=\"_blank\">http://awesomeinc.org/information/team-alpha/<\/a> Special shout outs to last semester&rsquo;s team alpha for creating the environment and culture that promotes excellence - Eric Prince, Chase Bullock, Sarah Frank, and Simeon Kondev.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>One of the pictures on the break room wall at Awesome Inc is of Tom Perkins. I would speculate that most of my friends don&rsquo;t know of Tom Perkins. Most of them probably don&rsquo;t even know of his venture capital firm<a href=\"http://www.kpcb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers<\/a>, (KPCB) which happens to be one of the first and most successful VC firms in Silicon Valley. Of course my friends heads will turn when you mention some of the companies in the KPCB portfolio: Google, Amazon, Compaq. Tom Perkins is just one of the almost forty entrepreneurial rock stars on our wall at Awesome Inc.<\/p>\n\n<p> <\/p>\n<p>Redefining the definition of &ldquo;awesome&quot; has been a core mission of Awesome Inc since we opened the doors almost a year ago. Whether it&rsquo;s through <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/2009/12/29/celebrating-victory/\" target=\"_blank\">rewarding success<\/a>, <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/2009/12/18/how-to-get-people-to-fail-more/\" target=\"_blank\">encouraging failure<\/a>, or <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/2010/01/19/awesome-inc-welcomes-in-the-team-alpha-spring-class-of-2010/\" target=\"_blank\">recruiting all-stars<\/a>, we plan to change the social norm. Awesome Inc is working to provide an environment where if you aren&rsquo;t doing something innovative, starting your own business or building something of value, you&rsquo;re the odd one out. It&rsquo;s about creating a culture where hard work, innovation, and taking risks are not only encouraged, but rewarded.<\/p>\n\n<p>Everyone on our rock star wall has done something &quot;awesome&rdquo;. Not in the sense that they are famous for what they&rsquo;ve done, but rather that they took on insurmountable odds and took ridiculous chances where failure seemed not only probable, but almost certain. And they all did it in pursuit of their own definition of awesome.<\/p>\n\n<p>People like Larry Page &amp; Sergey Brin who redefined the internet search engine with the creation of Google.<\/p>\n<p>People like Ralph G. Anderson whose <a href=\"http://belcan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">company<\/a>, Belcan, made only $200 in the first three years, but later went onto employ 4,000 people and earns $250 Mil annually.<\/p>\n<p>People like David Cohen of <a href=\"http://www.techstars.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Techstars<\/a> and Paul Graham of <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Y Combinator<\/a> who are currently changing the way investments are made in startups.<\/p>\n<p>People like Lee Todd who chose challenge over comfort every step of the way from his small town in Earlington, KY, to Murray, to UK, to MIT, to launching a company that was later sold to IBM.<\/p>\n<p>People like Jack Welch who worked his way up from junior engineer to become CEO of GE.<\/p>\n\n<p>These are just some of the names that make up the wall of rock stars, their picture forming a giant &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; on the walls at Awesome Inc.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, while our rock stars may not be like your rock stars (rule #2, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqLPHrCQr2I&amp;feature=player_embedded\" target=\"_blank\">Intel, 2009<\/a>) they do have one in thing in common: they are changing the world.<\/p>"

      "regular-title": "Introducing AwesomeCamp!",
      "regular-body": "<p>We wanted to answer an inevitable question up front:<\/p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s the deal with AwesomeCamp?<\/p>\n<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not going to insult your intelligence by just copying and pasting the information from <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/awesomecamp/\" target=\"_blank\">the page itself<\/a>(you can obviously read) so I&rsquo;m going to talk more about the story BEHIND AwesomeCamp and more of what AwesomeCamp will feel like if you want to know the schedules, mentors, cost, services, etc. check the actual<a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/awesomecamp/\" target=\"_blank\">page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Okay, so the back story. Needless to say we have a TON of people come to Awesome Inc and just say hey, I&rsquo;ve got an idea for a company. What do I do? We&rsquo;re happy to meet with these people and sometimes they have a specific request (i.e. funding, marketing, software development) and we can point them to the correct resource and we&rsquo;re done but other times it&rsquo;s not that easy.<\/p>\n<p>Oftentimes they will have no clue what they think they need to do. They&rsquo;ll just have all these ideas about what they think they should focus on. Their mind is spinning around like a Tazmanian Devil. So we&rsquo;ll spend 30 minutes to an hour with them helping them get their head on straight and figure out what they need to do, who they need to call, what they need to write, or figure out, etc.<\/p>\n<p>This point is critical because now we&rsquo;ve been able to:<\/p>\n<p>1. help them get everything out of their head<\/p>\n<p>2. organize all these thoughts and concepts (i.e. people will say things like &ldquo;I need to design a website, do marketing, make a flier, and get a facebook page up&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll help them mentally simplify and chunk things so it&rsquo;s not overwhelming. In this instance, we&rsquo;d point out that marketing is really the heading, and all the other things they just mentioned go under that)<\/p>\n<p>3. prioritize them<\/p>\n<p>4. clarify what the three most important next action items are.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone that we&rsquo;ve met with that&rsquo;s come to us with an idea has said that just this 30 minutes to an hour long session helps them SO MUCH by making the whole business idea less overwhelming. It&rsquo;s empowering because they know EXACTLY what they need to go out and DO IT.<\/p>\n<p>If they were doing a 2 hour session with us then we&rsquo;d probably be able to help them knock out the first 2 of their 3 most important action items on their list just through the contacts that we have or the zillion other business ideas that we have tested out.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s like the iron is red hot and ready to strike!<\/p>\n<p>Heck if they spent the afternoon with us they might even have a first stinking customer! But they don&rsquo;t have all afternoon, they don&rsquo;t even have two hours, now this doesn&rsquo;t mean they couldn&rsquo;t just go ahead and make the calls right there at the conference room table once we&rsquo;re finished meeting,they could. We don&rsquo;t schedule meetings for longer than 30 minutes, unless it&rsquo;s an entrepreneur with an idea in which case we sometimes give them an hour but nothing is stopping them from making progress except their own schedules&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>They just don&rsquo;t have time to run their business?<\/p>\n<p>To pursue their dream?<\/p>\n<p>To take action on that thing that&rsquo;s been eating at them for months and sometimes years?&hellip;No time?&hellip;Really?<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" class=\"aligncenter \" height=\"288\" src=\"http://www.seoconsultants.com/just-say-no/images/no-time-480.gif\" title=\"no time\" width=\"288\"/><\/p>\n<p>Well the fact is of course they have time and of course this their dream and so is eating healthy, getting in shape, being a good dad, student, son, etc.<\/p>\n<p>So other things get in the way makes sense. Don&rsquo;t worry, this happens to us all the time.<\/p>\n<p>But what about the things they do make time for? Video games, sports, cards, kids, work, etc.<\/p>\n<p>They are comfortable doing these things. Why? They have LOTS of experience with them. They&rsquo;ve done them for hours and hours on end so it just feels natural, relaxingâ€¦like they are in the zone.<\/p>\n<p>Well, what do you think we feel like at Awesome Inc all day long? Startups are our ZONE! What if you came home and instead of playing video games you worked on your idea and it felt JUST AS GOOD or how about BETTER than playing video games, watching TV, or whatever else you spend your free time doing?<\/p>\n<p>How Awesome would that be?!<\/p>\n<p>Okay so back to the backstory, we meet with people, get them totally psyched and prepared, they leave right when they are ready to get to work, and never actually get started (although they are completely ready) because they don&rsquo;t have time which really means they are just not comfortable with it yet. It feels like ˜work&quot;, it&rsquo;s awkward, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing we realized is that almost as soon as we send someone on their way, if they do start making progress, one random piece of advice or feedback from someone (especially someone that is a successful businessman but that has never started their own company) and they jump off track in heartbeat.<\/p>\n<p>Even people that have started their own business, pulled the trigger on their dreams and are living them right now come to us and tell me how they know that there are certain parts of their operation that are just plain screwed up and I mean WAY OFF they want to get our advice or time, etc. Sometimes we will spend some time with them right there on the spot and try to see if we can get them squared away.<\/p>\n<p>But they often end up not doing anything with the system we set up for them because they have so much other stuff going on. Translate: They aren&rsquo;t comfortable with it yet. It feels awkward.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" class=\"aligncenter \" height=\"198\" src=\"http://static.pyzam.com/img/funnypics/3/pyzamawkward.jpg\" title=\"awkward\" width=\"298\"/><\/p>\n<p>PLUS we see a lot of the <strong>same problems<\/strong> in both the pre-launch and post-launch companies that we know or that come to us for advice.<\/p>\n<p>SO the thought process went like this Okay people with ideas all need to go through a similar process to get started. They need to get comfortable with the tools and systems necessary to get them rolling and we&rsquo;ve got to get them to take action as soon as they are clear about their next steps. But they need more time and probably not just an extra hour because we&rsquo;ll have to keep recalibrating them for their first few steps or they might fall hopelessly off. And regardless it will take them some time to be comfortable. The same thing is happening with small startup businesses, how do we rock them more effectively and efficiently and make them not just comfortable with the process, but enjoy it?<\/p>\n<p>BAM! AwesomeCamp!<\/p>\n<p>Okay great so that&rsquo;s the need that we saw and the backstory now to what will Awesomecamp feel like?!<\/p>\n<p>Here it is in mathematical form for you tech guys in the house:<\/p>\n<p>Party + bootcamp + deepest conversation of your life + most efficient networking event ever + personal trainer pushing you way past your last rep + jumping off a cliff with no parachute and a box of metal planning to build a plane on the way down = AwesomeCamp<\/p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve read about how we came to the idea, what the week should be like should be pretty obvious we&rsquo;re going to get you clear and focused, and get you to PULL THE TRIGGER, CRACK THE WHIP, MAKE IT RAIN!!!!<\/p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll have super short deadlines to hit multiple times per day. Brian, Luke, and others from Team Awesome will be there to coach you in real time (almost none of the classroom lecture stuff, we will be there guiding you AS IT GOES DOWN ever heard the phrase, it&rsquo;s impossible to steer a parked car?&hellip;yeah same thing it&rsquo;s also the same reason that the UK basketball team doesn&rsquo;t spend all of every practice session listening to Calipari talk and draw up plays they GO PLAY BASKETBALL).<\/p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re going to be in the trenches next to other people that are pushing towards their definition of awesome.<\/p>\n<p>As soon as you need to get a question answered or connected to someone we&rsquo;re on the phone with them. We&rsquo;ve got a <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/awesomecamp/Mentors/\" target=\"_blank\">list of mentors<\/a> that have agreed to be on call for the week, willing to answer any emails or phone calls that have to do with helping AwesomeCamp participants.<\/p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to make you comfortable, with all the aspects of starting and running a business by making sure we get you spending as much time as possible ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING and that what you are doing is THE RIGHT THING.<\/p>\n<p>By the time you&rsquo;re finished you&rsquo;ll not only be comfortable with moving rapidly on an idea, but you&rsquo;ll be coached on how to move rapidly IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.<\/p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to take you to some places in Lexington that we guarantee you&rsquo;ve never been, introduce you to people we know you&rsquo;ve never met, and most importantly we&rsquo;re going to GET YOUR BUSINESS FARTHER IN A WEEK THAN YOU COULD GET IT IN A MONTH BY YOURSELF.<\/p>\n<p>You&rsquo;re gonna be dead tired by the end of AwesomeCamp on Saturday but you&rsquo;ll have an IDEA that is ALIVE!<\/p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s the backstory. And that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s gonna feel like.<\/p>\n<p>Any questions? Ask Jay Z<\/p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I came I saw I conquered&quot; Rule #76 No excuses. Play like a champion. luke@awesomeinc.org<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>For those of you that haven&rsquo;t known, I have been behind the scenes at Awesome Inc. running the social media campaign as a volunteer for nearly a year now. I did it in hopes of meeting great people and seeing tech and/or creative communities grow in Lexington. The experience has been wonderful both personally and professionally as I met some great people, some who turned into clients for my <a href=\"http://amartindesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">graphic design business<\/a>, and some who turned into valuable colleagues.<\/p>\n<p> During my time at Awesome Inc., we were able to reach some pretty big milestones in the social media space as we achieved over 1,000 <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/awesomeincorporated\" target=\"_blank\">facebook<\/a> fans, and 500+ <a href=\"http://twitter.com/awesome_inc\" target=\"_blank\">twitter<\/a> followers; we also began live streaming events on the social web and responding to viewers in real-time. Something no one was doing at the time in Lexington, KY.<\/p>\n<p>At some of our events, we even experimented with the audience live tweeteing their questions on a screen behind the speakers.<\/p>\n<p>I also introduced the hashtag to Awesome Inc. and perhaps its greatest use was on twitter during the Awesome Inc. Mobile Conference in the summer of 2009. A great community was formed and conference attendees were able to keep up with what others were doing during their time in Lexington, KY. The conference was even later renamed and rebranded based on the hashtag #mobilex for #mobile #lex<\/p>\n<p>My time at Awesome Inc. has indeed been awesome, and it was as a pleasure meeting and interacting with most of you; unfortunately all good things must eventually come to an end.<\/p>\n<p>With the recent birth of a son, my growing <a href=\"http://amartindesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">design business<\/a>, as well as Social Media Club Lexington, which I founded in 2008, it&rsquo;s time for me to gear my focus elsewhere. Therefore it is not without some sadness that I am announcing my resignation from Awesome Inc. I am bowing out gracefully and leaving it in good hands as Dave McGee will be the new Social Media Director. He is very knowledgeable in the space and will do a mighty fine job.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you all for the experiences and conversations. Please feel free to <a href=\"http://www.amartindesign.me/\" target=\"_blank\">stay in touch<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Kindest Regards and Rule #4,<\/p>\n<p>Adam Martin <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/amartindesign\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.twitter.com/amartindesign<\/a><\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>Okay, so this whole idea of a week of ludicrous speed business growth seems to be a bit tough for people to wrap their heads around. I feel you, that makes sense.<\/p>\n<p>If someone came to me and said &ldquo;Hey Luke, I&rsquo;m going get Awesome Inc to go from 100mph to 400 mph starting basically, now, I would at best be a bit skeptical and at worse just flat out not talk to the guy.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d probably be a bit defensive too, Have you seen how hard we work? I mean, we put on 4 mobile conferences in different cities in 2 months! What are you going to help us put on 16 in the same timeframe?<\/p>\n<p>Fine, we get it. So we decided to show you what&rsquo;s possible in an action packed hour that will simulate just one of the 70+ you&rsquo;ll be putting in in the 6 days of AwesomeCamp.<\/p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll go through the 1 hour long clarification process that we do with almost everybody that I help when it&rsquo;s &quot;on purpose&rdquo; (read they actually scheduled some time to meet with me with a clear agenda so we could make some progress). This session will be just a small taste of what the week will be like, but in it we&rsquo;ll be able to DELIVER VALUE in a whole bunch of ways right off the bat by helping you with:<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Prioritization<\/strong> What are you wasting your time on that doesn&rsquo;t matter? THIS STEP ALONE IS WORTH EVERY DIME OF THE CAMP&rsquo;S COST! It could help you shave weeks off right away by simply NOT doing a whole bunch of stuff you think you need to do but actually don&rsquo;t.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure<\/strong> You can&rsquo;t do every job so how do you delegate and outsource the others? The answer: Build infrastructure we&rsquo;ll show some examples and help you build some of your own.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Motivation<\/strong> Worried that you don&rsquo;t have what it takes? We&rsquo;re going to get you pumped up AND we&rsquo;ll point out several people that have LESS talent and potential than you in a lot of ways that are making it happen!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Networking <\/strong>Want to connect with people that are serious about making their ideas happen? Well, why don&rsquo;t you meet them here? That way you can keep in touch with them and if you don&rsquo;t go to AwesomeCamp you can just have them teach you everything they learned ;)<\/p>\n<p><strong>MORE <\/strong>We&rsquo;ll have a few fun/funny surprises for you, but that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m telling you for now.<\/p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s it! <strong>Monday, June 28th at 6pm<\/strong> - come to a value-packed free event (that we&rsquo;ll be streaming live and posting later for those that can&rsquo;t make it). Get a taste of how AwesomeCamp is going to go down and see if it&rsquo;s something you want to do this summer!<\/p>\n<p>See you there! Until then, follow rule #26 Never let stupid things keep you from doing awesome things.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><img class=\"alignleft\" height=\"197\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2249/3533395983_e846d2cf51.jpg\" title=\"Get Your Name Out\" width=\"590\"/><\/p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing I love more than walking into a room full of important people or introducing myself to a high-level executive at a certain corporation, saying &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Aaron Fons&rdquo; and seeing their eyes light up. Not having to explain who you are can come in extremely handy, and when you walk into a room and everyone knows who you are without the hassle of having to give a tired elevator pitch, it provides an instant shot to your self-confidence.<\/p>\n<p>Unless you&rsquo;re walking into a room full of psychics, however, chances are people aren&rsquo;t going to know your name without you putting in a little bit of work at the get-go. No one will know your name if you don&rsquo;t take the extra effort to put it out in the first place, and no one will care about it if you&rsquo;re not bringing anything to the table. To get your name out effectively, you need to begin by creating some sort of value ahead of time for whoever you end up meeting with.<\/p>\n<p>The first step is to identify your target. Figure out exactly who you want your name to resonate with by the time it&rsquo;s all said and done; if you don&rsquo;t know names, at least figure out the audience that you need to address as specifically as possible. For example, knowing that you want the board of directors at a given corporation to know who you are is better than knowing that you want &ldquo;some execs&rdquo; to know who you are. Once you have your general audience down, see if you can figure out their names and their interests; figure out what makes them tick.<\/p>\n<p>Once you know who you&rsquo;re dealing with and have your target isolated, you can more easily figure out how to address them and what interaction you can create that will make you seem different from everybody else. If you know you have a meeting or conference coming up with them, send out an email or pick up the phone a week or so before the conference to introduce yourself. Come up with something more interesting to say than a simple &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about the upcoming conference.&rdquo; Rather, add a specific detail that you&rsquo;re excited about or address a particular issue or interest that you have and hope will be touched on in more detail later. This way, you don&rsquo;t come off as someone who is looking to kiss ass, but rather as someone who is proactive and wants to learn more. If necessary, include a resume or letter of reference so that whoever you&rsquo;re talking to can find out a little more about you before the meeting. With one of these documents as well as a letter expressing interest, you are no longer just a name.<\/p>\n<p>The next step is going further than becoming more than just a face. When you finally are in the same room as your target, walk up coolly and confidently and introduce yourself. Everyone else is going to say &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Joe Nobody. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here.&rdquo; YOU, on the other hand, get to say &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m Joe Baller. We spoke this past week about (whatever you spoke about) and it&rsquo;s nice to put a face to your name.&rdquo; Watch and see how different their reaction is upon meeting you for the first time than it is for everyone else. Congratulations, they now know your name, and won&rsquo;t soon forget it.<\/p>\n<p>But you&rsquo;re nowhere near done. You must follow up. If you said you were curious to learn more about a certain topic, research it and have questions and conversation ready to go on it, so they know that you were serious. Create conversation that adds value, rather than focusing on the same questions everyone else asks. Once your bit is said and done, don&rsquo;t forget to write a thank you note, and in it address one or two additional topics you didn&rsquo;t touch on before. If you&rsquo;ve done your job right, this person will remember you and tell people about you. The next time you have a similar meeting or conference, this person will likely tell other execs about you and make your job a lot easier, but that shouldn&rsquo;t stop you from starting the process all over again. By the time it&rsquo;s over with, your name will ring out loud and clear.<\/p>"

Lexington web developer Tyler Green sure does, and he has created a new social network, Stadium Fanatic, to connect with other sports fans who feel the same.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed going around to ballparks, taking photos, and just experiencing the atmosphere, so I thought it would be a good idea to develop a place on the web where people could share those feelings,&rdquo; says Green, whose site allows users to document and share their sports venue experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Visits, comments, and photos are the main components to the social network. Users are encouraged to mark stadiums in which they have attended an event as &lsquo;Visited&rsquo;, and watch their name climb the leaderboard as their number of visits increases. Commenting on venues allows users to share their favorite experiences and offer suggestions for future visitors. The final feature, sharing photos, Green feels is the highlight of the site. &ldquo;I could spend days browsing photos of stadiums. Every venue is different and I think creating this community will help those who are interested explore them in ways they may not have been able to in the past.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Outside of the online network, users are encouraged to use the hashtag &rsquo;#AwesomeStadium&rsquo; when updating their Twitter accounts from a sports venue to group their updates with those of others. The use of hashtags creates a live update stream and allows users, who are either at the same park or not, to read about the various stadium experiences occurring at that moment.<\/p>\n<p>You can start connecting with Stadium Fanatics across the country today by visiting<a href=\"http://www.stadiumfanatic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.stadiumfanatic.com.<\/a><\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>Okay, so yesterday was the first official full-blown day of AwesomeCamp, and while it was even better than I imagined it to be, I have to give a nod to the guy that actually did a beta-AwesomeCamp week a couple weeks ago before I start posting about the details and the experience of this week.<\/p>\n<p>As I was sharing the concept of AwesomeCamp with <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/#!/profile.php?id=1197090043&amp;ref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron Fons<\/a> of<a href=\"http://befresh.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Fresh<\/a> he was dissappointed to find out that it was going to be held exactly one week from the day that he would be leaving for Washington, DC to go work for IBM for the fall. He really wanted to have the intense experience and rapid growth that AwesomeCamp offered, and I honestly needed to get some basic experience regarding how to actually conduct a week&rsquo;s worth of mentored guidance so I agreed to give him my attention for the week of July 19-24. I learned the following things from this experience:<\/p>\n<ul><li>It is important for me to <strong>DO <\/strong>as little as possible.\n<ul><li>I often would want to jump in and &lsquo;help&rsquo; Aaron by doing things for him that I already knew how to do and enjoyed thoroughly. This ended up robbing him of the opportunity to actually learn the skill (and gain confidence in his ability to learn other skills) and so I battled the urge with increasing success throughout the week. My greatest success I think being his setting up of a free phone-automation account via phonebooth.com (he said, &ldquo;Hey, we need a phone line for the business&rdquo; I said &ldquo;phonebooth.com is a simple, free, and adequate solution - go sign up for an account and set everything up. Let me know if you get stuck.&rdquo; - end of mentorship session on 'How to Set Up a Phone Line for Your Business&rsquo;)<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Simple is important and <strong>really <\/strong>difficult\n<ul><li>There are three rules of AwesomeCamp 1. Schedule 2. Attitude &amp; 3. Simple. I will go into details about these in the future, but for now I just want to say that helping Aaron (and almost any entrepreneur I talk to) keep their lists short and their focus clear is the hardest thing and takes wisdom, courage, and maturity that many times I would not have were I not responsible for providing it to Aaron.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>The benefits of AwesomeCamp are about the experience and the relationships - not necessarily the business progress.\n<ul><li>Fresh made more progress during the six days of AwesomeCamp than it had made in the previous six weeks&hellip;but who cares? So our business now has 3-4 months worth of progress behind it (assuming that the AwesomeCamp week was approximately as productive as the first 6 weeks) - that&rsquo;s not enough time and work to say 'Whew! Glad we&rsquo;re finished building a successful business now! What <strong>did<\/strong> happen that I am proud of and that I know will be something foundational to Fresh&rsquo;s success in the long term is the attitude, skillset, thought process, and habits that I helped ingrain in Aaron ('Fons&rsquo;) during the week.<\/li>\n<li>Secondly, and more importantly, we got really close and had a great time as friends. Because the single biggest contributor to happiness and the single largest impact on our behavior are both the people that we surround ourselves with, our friendship and it&rsquo;s foundation in the business that we are building together (with it&rsquo;s core values being central to that business) will be the main thing that keeps Fons, myself, and every other <a href=\"http://freshmen.posterous.com/23592305\" target=\"_blank\">FreshMan<\/a> motivated &amp; enjoying the long road of building a sustainable enterprise that lays ahead. Those friendships make it worth pursuing more than anything else, and that&rsquo;s what AwesomeCamp (Beta) taught be more than anything else.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>So, to my business partner, and fellow FreshMan, Fons - thanks for teaching me what will be necessary to make this first &ldquo;real&rdquo; week of AwesomeCamp a big success thus far, and thanks for&hellip;well&hellip;being my friend.<\/p>"

The participants worked hard every day from 8 am till 9 pm. Read on and get to know the AwesomeCamp companies and participants. Also, be sure to check out the AwesomeCamp music video at the bottom of this post!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Amalgamations Studios:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Amalgamations Studios\" src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4102/4858296190_33fa17c6f7_z.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>Amalgamations Studios (<a href=\"http://amalgamationsstudios.com/\" target=\"_blank\">amalgamationsstudios.com<\/a>) is a web and software development company. Amalgamations Studios targeted customers are small, medium, and home businesses, across the globe. Amalgamations Studios will tackle any type of project the client wants done.<\/p>\n<p>Amalgamations Studios came to AwesomeCamp in order to get started and get customers. The main goal they hope to achieve at AwesomeCamp is to become profitable.<\/p>\n<p>Amalgamations Studios is a one man team consisting of Dave Boyer, who was sick of working for other people and after doing this for 2-3 years on his own, he&rsquo;s making it his business. His hardest challenge has been getting experience so he&rsquo;d have the opportunity to get experience, and AwesomeCamp has been helpful in making him set aside time he wouldn&rsquo;t normally set aside to work on Amalgamations Studios. Because Dave&rsquo;s business is just getting started, all the marathon sessions at AwesomeCamp have been especially productive<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fresh:<\/strong><\/p>\n<img alt=\"Fresh\" src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4123/4857657111_5041da84a4.jpg\" width=\"300\"/><p>Fresh (<a href=\"http://befresh.us/\" target=\"_blank\">befresh.us<\/a>) is a door to door laundry service in Lexington with a 24 hour turnaround. Their core value is to provide &ldquo;fresh, flawless laundry done fast by friends having fun.&rdquo; Customers sign up on the website and pick a schedule to have their laundry done every 1 or 2 weeks. Fresh washes, dries, and folds the laundry before dropping it back off. Fresh is perfect for college students and young professionals and they hope to eventually contract with restaurants and hotels.<\/p>\n<p>Fresh is at AwesomeCamp to design their internal infrastructure and marketing plan. UK starts in 2 weeks and they want to be ready to go, and AwesomeCamp has made them set hard deadlines to get work done. The Fresh team has done trials run with family and friends&rsquo; laundry, met with local laundromat owners, and at AwesomeCamp they&rsquo;ve been creating their brand by making videos and handout cards with their core values.<\/p>\n<p>Fresh started as an idea for a fast food delivery service between classmates Garrett Ebel and Aaron Fons. After teaming up with Awesome Inc.&rsquo;s Luke Murray the idea evolved into a laundry service. Then Matt &ldquo;Cool&rdquo; Storrs and Lauren Fleming joined too, finishing off the Fresh team. All of them have been hard at work at AwesomeCamp.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ModelSensation:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"ModelSensation\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4139/4867683474_741a38e1eb.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>ModelSensation (<a href=\"http://modelsensation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">modelsensation.com<\/a>) is a model photography and promotion company. They help companies advertise products or services, and provide advertising companies with talent for events like commercials or special occasions. ModelSensation hopes to have their brand evolve to licensing contracts to apparel and merchandise and have TV and media products to feature the models.<\/p>\n<p>ModelSensation was founded to provide opportunities for talented people in the Lexington area. ModelSensation&rsquo;s greatest reward has been witnessing models being able to realize their dreams.<\/p>\n<p>Acknowledging that people pay attention to beautiful models, ModelSensation wants to direct this attention to important issues like fighting racism by having many nationalities of models. ModelSensation is about seeing models as humans and not just a means to sell a product.<\/p>\n<p>For AwesomeCamp participant Zabu Mutua, photography was just a hobby until he realized that it takes just one person with a dream to become successful. Although ModelSensation has been around for 3 years, Zabu came to AwesomeCamp because the complexity of even the most modest project requires organization and structure. Image is everything in the modeling world, and ModelSensation strives to always be professional and not miss opportunities due to a lack of foresight. At AwesomeCamp, Zabu has been able to accomplish a lot in short period of time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OMG!itsuhcamel:D<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"OMG!itsuhcamel:D\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4139/4858287376_5fdd30edb5.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>OMG!itsuhcamel:D (<a href=\"http://youtube.com/user/OMGitsuhcamelpro\" target=\"_blank\">youtube.com/user/OMGitsuhcamelpro<\/a>) is a video production company where they do &ldquo;everything but act&rdquo;. From filming, editing, to even writing scripts, for anyone needing a promotional video, they do it all. They also launch their own videos, aimed at the younger crowd, on their YouTube page.<\/p>\n<p>Drew Trommer attended a NY film academy and took a year long course on video production at Bryan Station High School. He met Alexie Basil through a mutual friend and ended up helping her with a school project. It turned out so well they decided to keep working together creatively. Their biggest obstacle is their creative differences, which is where AwesomeCamp comes in.<\/p>\n<p>Drew and Alexie came to AwesomeCamp to get more experience and publicity, but the greatest benefit has been working together so much and working towards a common artist product when they have differing visions. Throughout AwesomeCamp, they have been working with 12 year old Charlotte Arnold on her YouTube show It&rsquo;s The Charlotte Show (youtube.com/user/itsthecharlotteshow).<\/p>\n<p><strong>PI Modeling:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"PI Modeling\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4102/4867068193_4db0380aec.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>Pope International Model Management (PIMrising.wordpress.com) focuses on innovations in modeling and fashion and development of talent. They are filling the void in model management in Lexington &ldquo;with the belief that the best company for models is the one run by models.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Rory Pope has been a model for 11+ years so he can help his clients navigate the sometimes exploitative modeling market. Trying to break the stereotype that models are just a product and not people, he wants to be an advocate for talents and get their careers on a positive path so they won&rsquo;t be turned off by bad experiences.<\/p>\n<p>PI Modeling is partnered with ModelSensation, Pandora Photography, and Jordan Yoder photography. PI Modeling&rsquo;s upcoming project, to be premiered at Awesome Inc., is the &ldquo;Body Is Beautiful&rdquo; campaign. This focuses on promoting female beauty no matter size or age in hopes to empower women.<\/p>\n<p>PI Modeling came to AwesomeCamp to find focus and benefit from the mentorship available. Their goals are to define core values, create a hotdog stand, and gain capital. Rory likes the structure and formality of AwesomeCamp. Everyone is there to work and be productive.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Remix Education:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Remix Education\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4095/4857668111_7d1fc24143.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>Remix Education (<a href=\"http://remixeducation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">remixeducation.com<\/a>) provides motivational assemblies at schools and churches using interactive mascot performances. Each assembly is tailored to the particular group, but some topics are antidrug, anti bullying, and the Gospel. The programs are a fun, entertaining way to educate kids about living better and healthier.<\/p>\n<p>Remix Education programs are for kids of any grade. While available at any place they are wanted or needed, they currently work mainly in Kentucky. The hope in the near future is to expand to other states and eventually go on mission trips to other countries. Remix Education wants to have the opportunities to impact more people and spread the Gospel.<\/p>\n<p>In order to reach these goals, and overcome their biggest challenge of being unorganized, Remix Education came to AwesomeCamp. Their aim is to get a better system in place to run their business like a business, have an expansion plan, and be able to franchise. The most helpful part of AwesomeCamp has been the marathon session where they got High Rise CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software; they now have a new program to keep track of clients.<\/p>\n<p>The members of Remix Education at AwesomeCamp are Matt and Jenny Hogg and Butch Vernon. They were inspired by the Gospel, their love of kids, and entertaining, and wanted to use their talents to help kids. Matt has a background as a mascot for many different teams, and Jenny is a cheerleader, skills they use to pump students up. They have enjoyed the unique features of AwesomeCamp such as starting at the YMCA in the morning to get energized, and being able to meet and interact with other AwesomeCamp participates.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rockstar Association:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Rockstar Assocation\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4115/4858301220_31ab0d2a13.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>Rockstar Association (<a href=\"http://rockstarassociation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">rockstarassociation.com<\/a>) is all about human interaction in the music industry because there is no separation between music and life. Rockstar Association wants to foster a creative atmosphere where they can build strong alliances to the music industry and help make connections among them. With the goal of bringing together musicians in the Lexington area to form relationships based on a mutual love of music, Rockstar Association is well served by musician and AwesomeCamp participant Nathan LeClaire.<\/p>\n<p>Not only able to sing and play guitar, bass, drums, and keys, Nathan also has a technical background to help with the business side of things. Most important to him though is the ability to relate to people. Nathan convinced Awesome Inc. neighbor Farzin to let Rockstar Association have jam sessions in his space. Just a few months old, Rockstar Association has held a few jam sessions already but hopes to host regular sessions in the future. With the belief that people should help each other out, Nathan created the theme song for another AwesomeCamp participant&rsquo;s show. This human connection is what makes Rockstar Association more than just about finding rehearsal spaces, but about getting to know and help musicians personally.<\/p>\n<p>The Rockstar Association office at Awesome Inc. is in a loft accessed solely by a rock wall. This fun, relaxed environment coupled with Brian and Luke&rsquo;s charms brought Rockstar Association to AwesomeCamp to &ldquo;meet awesome people, learn awesome things, and play awesome music.&rdquo; The best part of AwesomeCamp is the structure of work versus play. The day starts out at the YMCA, where they hang out and read before working out. Then it&rsquo;s time to be focused and work, and the marathon sessions make it easy to keep on task. As Nathan says, &ldquo;AwesomeCamp is awesome!&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Beer Guy:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"The Beer Guy\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4121/4867684144_75f0ff8a66.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>Unofficially known as &ldquo;The Beer Guy&rdquo;, Evan Blanford is a quality beer enthusiastic. He loves talking about beer- the way it&rsquo;s made, what glass should be used, and especially its story. Evan is working on a website with videos, blog posts, and interviews with beer enthusiasts and people in the industry, such as home brewers. He hopes to do half as much in the beer industry as his inspiration, Gary Vaynerchuk, has done in the wine industry.<\/p>\n<p>Hardly a drinker, Evan prefers to have just one well made beer. He first discovered that beer could taste good while visiting Belgium. He was enlightened on how much he didn&rsquo;t know and has been striving to learn more about beer ever since.<\/p>\n<p>Evan came to AwesomeCamp because it is filled with inspirational and motivational people in a relaxed environment. He thought it sounded easy to start his company, but he never found the time before AwesomeCamp. With the constructive pressure at AwesomeCamp, Evan feels nothing is out of reach.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Uvestor:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Uvestor (<a href=\"http://uvestor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">uvestor.com<\/a>) provides real estate software with business management tools to make the real estate industry less complicated and more transparent. Ideal for investors and brokers, Uvestor software helps with document management, expense tracking, and team communication.<\/p>\n<p>Uvestor&rsquo;s biggest obstacle is achieving product/market fit in a large industry. They hope to soon grow into the industry standard. With background in buying and selling short sales, they want to make the real estate industry less confusing.<\/p>\n<p>Participants Chris Combs and John Williamson did not view AwesomeCamp as a boot camp, but as an &ldquo;entrepreneur day spa&rdquo;. The spirit of entrepreneurships at Awesome Inc. revitalized their thinking and brought in new ideas. They have a special connection to Awesome Inc. because Luke Murray played matchmaker and brought them together as business partners.<\/p>\n<\/div>"

      "regular-body": "<p>This is the first post in a weekly series profiling all of the Awesome Inc. companies.<\/p>\n<p>The vision of The Comic Arts Partnership, or the Comic AP, is to engage the local community in the experience of the visual narrative of the Comic Arts. They foster local talent and provide an outlet for their content to be seen in Lexington, Ky.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bpsm-logo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"bpsm-logo\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3574/3780186472_cdab04f966.jpg\" title=\"bpsm-logo\" width=\"300\"/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Comic AP produces Blueprint Saint Magazine (<a href=\"http://www.blueprintsaintsmagazine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">blueprintsaintsmagazine.com<\/a>), which promotes visual sequential art, the formal name for graphic novels and comic books. Designed for the &ldquo;every man&rdquo;, the magazine is bringing together regional artists for a regional audience.<\/p>\n<p>The Comic AP is run democratically by nine board members that make up a team called Architect, including Blueprint Saints founder B.D. Kuchera, who leads the social element of the project which is called CCLive (Comic Creators Live). There are no paid staff members; they are all permanent volunteers. There are 124 comic creators being featured in the magazine, twelve writers, twelve fine artists, and a ten person design team.<\/p>\n<p>Blueprint Saints Magazine is a seventy two page, 11.25 x 13.5 inch, full color publication. 10,000 issues will be released every month. Since the Comic AP is a nonprofit entity, there is no cost to the reader and no advertisements in the magazine. There are thirteen styles or themes of comics. Knowing that every reader has their own taste, the Comic AP wants to enable the public to see the full gambit of the comic arts.<\/p>\n<p>Blueprint Saints Magazine is an open source print environment for comic creators, which means that all artists inside the publication retain their intellectual property. The Open Age of Comics allows for comic creators to be seen in print, yet still own all their property. Blueprint Saints Magazine does not take any ownership to any content created by the artists involved; they take no percentages, no membership dues, and have no requirement for any of the artists to stay. The Comic AP does not take funding from comic organizations in order to print Blueprint Saints Magazine, but takes funding only from arts organizations. Blueprint Saints Magazine is not a comic label, but an arts foundation that promotes Comic Arts.<\/p>\n<p>This is a risky, new idea that has faced resistance from certain facets of the local comic community. However, undaunted, the Comic AP, Comic Creators Live, and Blueprint Saints Magazine is venturing forward, sustaining and protecting the printed comic which has been around for eighty years. The team of Blueprint Saints Magazine has vowed to never make an electronic version of Blueprint Saints, as that would undermine the entire purpose of protecting the physical comic. Inspired by Harvey Pekar in Cleveland, Ohio, who started the underground comic movement, the Comic AP is not about changing how comics are drawn or read, but changing the environment in which they are created. As they say, &ldquo;we have a giraffe, and we&rsquo;re going to release it down Main Street. When you do that, all social media and digital technology will react. You don&rsquo;t get that from a website no one will ever see.&rdquo; So, in other words, people will notice this magazine.<\/p>"

Although the finalists haven&rsquo;t been announced yet, Webalytics is looking to beta launch its application at TechCrunch Disrupt this September 27-29.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch Disrupt is a startup launch conference that attracts top venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and corporate executives. In Startup Battlefield, twenty five teams are selected from hundreds to demo their products. Each is judged on its product, business model, team, design and usability. The top prize is $50,000 and the media exposure is priceless. Webalytics hopes to be selected to participate in Startup Battlefield because TechCrunch Disrupt is the place to launch a web-based application. Webalytics has created a &ldquo;work of art&rdquo; and wants to unveil it to the largest possible audience.<\/p>\n<p>Webalytics owner Wayne Yeager is no stranger to internet startup companies; Webalytics is his fourth. Others include Sellathon.com, which was acquired by Auctiva in 2006, Trafficology.com and Internet.com, both of which he was editor, and Unclaimed Domains, which was acquired by Jupiter Media in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>As with any of his startups, Yeager&rsquo;s biggest challenge is demonstrating the connection between what Webalytics does and how it makes the customer money. Webalytics will have to make the transition from early adopters to the larger market by being able to show people how the platform provides real, tangible value. However, Webalytics raised a $200,000 angel round earlier this year.<\/p>"

We have the public favorite, <a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/rules\" target=\"_blank\">rule #4<\/a>: &ldquo;always do something awesome over something not awesome&rdquo;. We have our soundtrack that includes <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3METMAHEnvk\" target=\"_blank\">the song<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5YJfPBqPNE\" target=\"_blank\">the other song<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhkg4bVJEZc\" target=\"_blank\">the thing<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMt8ZYaJKmA\" target=\"_blank\">number 3<\/a>. We have some secret hand shakes and some silly dances. <br/><br/>Another one of our core values at Awesome Inc is &ldquo;Forget em&hellip;do your thing&rdquo; (rule #2, credit Luke Murray, 2009). No matter what your mission, there are going to be people that agree with you and there are going to be people that disagree with you. Your critics get even louder as you become more influential. <br/><br/>It is so tempting to try to respond to all of these people that take a position against your initiative. Honestly, it makes you feel better in the short run to defend yourself to your critics. It&rsquo;s nice to blow off some steam and try to convince everyone why your position is right in hopes to win over your naysayers. <br/><br/>To be blunt, this is pointless behavior. Most of the time you aren&rsquo;t going to win anyone over and every second you spent defending yourself should have been spent pursuing your mission. It is simply a distraction that you have to disregard. As long as you&rsquo;re secure with your principles, and believe whole heartedly in your mission, there is no reason to be distracted from either of them. Focus on &ldquo;your thing&rdquo; and ignore your critics. <br/><br/>This doesn&rsquo;t mean don&rsquo;t listen to your customers or the people around you. This doesn&rsquo;t mean don&rsquo;t accept feedback or advice. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re always right and everyone else is wrong. It means don&rsquo;t listen to your doubters, believe in yourself and trust that game recognize game.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://fortunefeatures.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/3_buffett_gates-top.jpg?w=475&amp;h=324\" width=\"300\"/><\/p>\n<p>I recently read <a href=\"http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2010/06/16/gates-buffett-600-billion-dollar-philanthropy-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">an article about Bill Gates teaming up with Warren Buffet to raise $600 Billion for charity<\/a>(yes, that is a six with eleven zeros). They are calling the initiative Great Givers. Their plan idea, ask the 400 wealthiest people in the country to pledge 50% of their wealth to philanthropy. Warren Buffet is leading the way by donating 99% of his wealth.<\/p>\n<p>After reading the article I parsed through the comments section. To my surprise, a significant portion of the comments were negative and bashing of Gates and Buffet. I found quotes saying &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just doing this for their egos&rdquo; or &ldquo;after doing their part to destroy the U.S. economy, they now get to make it right by giving the money they obtained by destroying other peoples lives away&rdquo; or &ldquo;This is feel good altruism and more harmful than helpful.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was reading. I wanted to personally defend them from all their critics. And then I realized, &ldquo;wow&hellip;think about the amount of time that Gates and Buffet could spend responding to their critics. They could literally spend every waking moment of every single day defending themselves. Thankfully, they don&rsquo;t care what their doubters think and instead spend all that time doing their thing&rdquo;. Which currently appears to be changing the world through the Great Givers initiative. <br/><br/>My conclusions, Bill Gates has a lot of critics, a lot of haters, and a lot of people that disagree with what he is doing. But he has one ally who happens to be the richest man in the world. Game recognize game. He is also in the process of acquiring more allies that will really make a difference. He is confident and secure enough in his initiative that he ignores his critics. <br/><br/>The lesson: you&rsquo;re always going to have people that disagree with you and doubt your ideas, your abilities, and even your motives&hellip;Forget &lsquo;em - do your thing!<\/p>"

      "regular-title": "Focus on the Hot Dog",
      "regular-body": "<p>I&rsquo;m working with some UK students to start a <a href=\"http://kykernel.com/2010/09/09/laundry-service-booming/\" target=\"_blank\">door-to-door laundry service<\/a>. When we got together for the first time a few months ago, I started to ask them all the things that we needed to do. There were plenty of things that came out from social media campaigns, to logos, business cards, a phone line, slogans, a domain name &amp; website, etc. I then asked them what the they thought most important things were that they should be doing. They started to prioritize the list to some degree, but for the most part they wanted to do all of it at once. <br/><br/>What the founders of a brand new laundry service weren&rsquo;t talking about: learning how to pick up, wash, dry, fold, and deliver laundry in large volumes efficiently and with minimal errors. <br/><br/>In case you didn&rsquo;t catch that, it was like a bunch of guys talking about starting their own pizza shop, and not even putting &ldquo;learn how to make really good pizza&rdquo; on their to do list, much less have it at the top, or even better, have it as THE ONLY THING THEY SHOULD SPEND THEIR TIME ON. <br/><br/>There, of course, is a case for marketing and carrying yourself in a way that you look legit. I even brought up the idea of having polo shirts with our logos on them (hey, even I can&rsquo;t resist talking about the fun stuff, I mean, it&rsquo;s fun!). When you dress not just professionally (which doesn&rsquo;t cost you anything, remember? You already have polo shirts and khakis in your closet) but are branded professionally (business card, logo on your shirt, slick website, 800 number, etc.) it adds a level of confidence to the salesman or other company representative that is trying to convince the bank, or customer, or supplier to do business with us. This confidence, coupled with branded, professional appearance of the company representative, indeed do combine to improve your chances of closing a sale, a supplier, a loan, etc. But given the limited nature of your most valuable resource, your time, I would allocate more of it to washing laundry or making pizzas than I would to installing phone lines and putting up a fancy website for a few important reasons. <br/><br/><br/><br/>First, the cool stuff is only skin deep and it doesn&rsquo;t take a very inquisitive person to see that you&rsquo;re just a shell. For example, simple questions like How many customers do you have? How long have you been washing laundry? What makes your pizza different or better than any other pizza would be fumbled and all the confidence that you (and that customer) had in your company thanks to your professional appearance would deflate faster than a popped balloon. <br/><br/>Second, the cool stuff is expensive. The other finite resource you have (after time) is money. You should spend as little of it as possible, and only on the things that matter most (duh). If it was your last 10 dollars (or the only 10 dollars you could possibly spend to get that pizza shop off the ground) what would you spend it on? A logo? A t-shirt? Fliers? No you&rsquo;d spend it on some stinking tomatoes, cheese, and dough! Now, you might not have only 10 dollars, but if you don&rsquo;t spend money on the most important things first, you might soon be left with only 10 bucks, and you can&rsquo;t buy a whole lot of pizza making ingredients with that. So you now have to get it right the first time (and since you&rsquo;ve never done it before, you probably won&rsquo;t). <br/><br/>Third, focusing on the important stuff gives you real confidence. Remember that confidence I talked about earlier? The kind you get by dressing up like you&rsquo;re a real business? Let me tell you two things about that lingering feeling of &ldquo;Are we actually legitimate&rdquo;? that you&rsquo;re looking for. One, it&rsquo;s probably not going to go away for years. My business partner has run a software business for over three years now and he still asks that question from time to time. Two, the fastest way to confidently be able to answer that question with a yes is by knowing that your company is THE BEST at what you do because the best ALWAYS stay in business. It may make you feel good to give someone a branded email address (lmurray@laundrypros.com) on a fancy business card, that directs them to a smooth website, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel nearly as good as it does to look the banker, the customer, the investor, the supplier in the eye and say, we&rsquo;ve washed 375 loads of laundry with an error rate of 2% and an average turnaround time of 2.5 hours, which is twice as accurate and three times as fast as our competitors, and five times more accurate and six times better than the national average. How much are they going to care about your business card or your logo then? Be the best first. Be the prettiest second. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Fourth, and finally, statistically speaking, your business will fail. You probably won&rsquo;t make it past your first year and you almost definitely won&rsquo;t make it past your third year so because the clock is ticking, focus on answering the questions that are crucial to your survival: Do people really value having their laundry done? Can we make the best pizza in town? Is it possible to return laundry faster and with a higher degree of accuracy than our competitors? If you spend half your time during that crucial first year filing a bunch of paperwork (so your business can be legit) and thinking up cute slogans you may run out of time and money and not even know if you actually failed! It very well could be that it&rsquo;s possible to kick the crap out of the local pizza shop because they are lazier and less creative than you are but you spent only 20 of those 60 hours per week you spent on your business actually making pizzas! <br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t be an idiot if want to start pizza shops, laundry companies, or car detailing businesses, spend 90% of your time actually making pizzas, washing laundry, or cleaning cars NOTHING ELSE. <br/><br/><br/><br/>This entire post presupposes that you know what your core business is. The guys from <a href=\"http://37signals.com/\" target=\"_blank\">37 signals<\/a> wrote a book called <a href=\"http://37signals.com/rework/\" target=\"_blank\">Rework<\/a> and one of the chapters talks about focusing on the hot dog. Using the analogy of starting a hot dog stand they talk about all the decisions that you have to make: color of the umbrella, types of condiments, type of cart, location in the city, bun varieties, etc. There&rsquo;s a LOT to think about. However, if you don&rsquo;t have a <i>hot dog<\/i>, you don&rsquo;t have a hot dog <i>stand<\/i> so focus on the hot dog first and foremost. <br/><br/><br/><br/>This is simple for a pizza shop or a laundry business perhaps (unless the pizza shop is selling the most fun atmosphere, or the hottest waitresses and not necessarily the best pizza) but it might be much more difficult for other businesses. But knowing what your core business is - your hot dog - is the first thing you need to clarify before putting together the list of the dozens of other things you have on your mind about what needs to happen to get your idea off the ground.<\/p>"

Don&rsquo;t answer calls from your mom (or anyone for that matter) unless they are scheduled, for example.This, although not socially very acceptable (my mom doesn&rsquo;t like having to be put on my calendar nor do some of my friends), is actually a huge step in the right direction, but not the only step necessary for perfect execution of a plan.<\/p>\n<p>I have done the no cell phone, no internet, all the food and sleeping and toiletries in one place, no people thing before in medical school.Just me, a binder, a stack of notes and a plan I spent 2 hours putting together.The problem is that the other thing that has to happen for perfect execution of a plan (and therefore the complete utility of a plans creation to be experienced) is to know exactly how long it will take for each task to be completed at a predetermined level of quality.<\/p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s just one small problem with this.It&rsquo;s impossible.<\/p>\n<p>Now, both of these realizations (1. Eliminating every distraction is necessary to stick to a plan as is 2. knowing exactly how long each task in the plan will take in order to be completed at a predetermined level of quality and that this type of fortune telling is impossible) are not earth shattering.They take just a modicum of common sense and maybe 3 seconds of extrapolated logic to ultimately arrive at the question why spend any time planning at all?<\/p>\n<p>Well this answer is just as obvious:if you want to end up somewhere you at least have to head in that direction.<\/p>\n<p>The question then ultimately is this:If planning is necessary, but plans themselves are never accurate, how much time should you spend planning?<\/p>\n<p>The answer for myself (and probably you) is:at least 50% less time than I/you currently do.<\/p>\n<p>I like to plan for lots of reasons:<\/p>\n<ul><li>It engages the abstract part of my brain<\/li>\n<li>I get to be creative<\/li>\n<li>I get to visualize success<\/li>\n<li>I can put together the pieces and see that it is possible to accomplish what I&rsquo;ve set out accomplish, which gives me confidence.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>But probably the biggest reason I like planning so much is this:<\/p>\n<p>You can't <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/2009/12/18/how-to-get-people-to-fail-more/\" target=\"_blank\">fail<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When you write down on a plan how many sales you want to have this week, next week, and the week after you have just succeeded at planning.Good job.How tough was that?Well probably about 1 millionth as difficult as actually going out there, facing rejection, saying the wrong thing, wasting time talking to the wrong person, working through fatigue and ultimately not even hitting half of those numbers.<\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s failure but it's <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/2009/12/18/how-to-get-people-to-fail-more/\" target=\"_blank\">REAL PROGRESS too<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>From the inside, I&rsquo;d rather plan all day long than go out and actually do anything I just wrote down because I&rsquo;m afraid.From the outside, I&rsquo;d rather see me spend that 2 hours I just spent figuring out our goals for the upcoming quarter trying to pick some numbers I took 2 seconds to pull out of the air&hellip;and then going out and<strong>actually working<\/strong> to try and hit them.<\/p>\n<p>Props to the boys at 37 Signals that remind us that <a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1805-lets-just-call-plans-what-they-are-guesses\" target=\"_blank\">Planning Is Guessing<\/a>.<\/p>"

There was space for the studio in Awesome Inc., so she decided to take the opportunity to pursue her dream. Although she minored in business, she found that business plans are just a guide and you can never plan for all situations, but have to figure it out as you go.Owner and instructor Rebecca Fields has years of dance experience. She started dancing when she was 3 years old, attended SCAPA for 7 years, minored in dance at UK, and coaches a church dance group. She found there were no dance classes in Lexington for adults with full time jobs who just want to have a fun, social experience one night a week, so she started Premiere Dance.<\/p>\n<\/div>"

Punndit (<a href=\"http://punndit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">punndit.com<\/a>) is a contextual video blogging company that allows users to respond to and interact with all forms of nonprint media; this essentially means being able to respond to video with video. While there are many uses for this new platform, their starting focuses are sports and politics, since there are already lots of opinions and content for these topics.<\/p>\n<p>Owner Randall Stevens has 20 years experience in software development businesses. He&rsquo;s had the idea for video blogging for 10 years, but the timing hasn&rsquo;t been right until now. There are no other companies doing this, and the technology of having cameras in mobile devices and computers has finally caught up. Right now they are in the early stages of turning their idea into reality, and need customer feedback.<\/p>\n<p>At the launch party, guests will be able to use Punndit and start generating content. Punndit will get feedback from a broader audience and guests will be the first to see the newest technology. This is also a time to celebrate and share with family and friends what they&rsquo;ve been working on. The party is Thursday October 7th, from 8pm-11pm at the Punndit Offices at 163 East Main Street, 3rd Floor.

While available at any place they are wanted or needed, they currently work mainly in Kentucky. The hope in the near future is to expand to other states and eventually go on mission trips to other countries.

The user gets to be the director, choosing actors, music, backgrounds, graphics, and more, while DISS handles the production. As it is completely automated, anyone can use DISS.<\/p>\n<p>After the video is produced, there are many options for distribution. DISS can send it to ten of the top video sites online, or customers can order a full resolution version for television or trade shows. Since many of the videos are for websites, DISS provides the hosting so all the customer has to do is add the provided code to their site.<\/p>\n<p>Kyle Lake, owner of DISS, is also a part of its parent company, Prosper Media Group, a full line production company. They saw a need for a tool to allow businesses to create short form videos at low cost with professional quality, so they could get information across to their audience in a better way than just text on a website. DISS is great for digital display advertising, like the FuelView videos they produced at Shell Gas Stations, and training videos.<\/p>\n<p>DISS is currently working on the Great American Rivalry series, which previews top high school football games across the country. They also are working with the equestrian industry for website programming, upcoming events and features.<\/p>\n<p>DISS uses a system that&rsquo;s hands off, so the website must be robust and have an easy to use format. One challenge they face is keeping the technology up to date. They want to have a variety of music, graphics and actors. They have an active talent pool with more than twenty actors, and are always looking for more talent.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest challenge, however, has been getting the word out about their services. DISS is fairly new, with the beta version launching in 2008, so while their customers have loved their videos so far, they want more exposure. They are reachable by email at kyle@doneinsixtyseconds.com or phone by calling 888-328-8330.<\/p>"

They help companies advertise products or services, and provide advertising companies with talent for events like commercials or special occasions. ModelSensation hopes to have their brand evolve to licensing contracts to apparel and merchandise and have TV and media products to feature the models.<\/p>\n<p>ModelSensation was founded to provide opportunities for talented people in the Lexington area. ModelSensation&rsquo;s greatest reward has been witnessing models being able to realize their dreams. Acknowledging that people pay attention to beautiful models, ModelSensation wants to direct this attention towards positive messages. ModelSensation is about seeing models as humans and not just a means to sell a product.<\/p>\n<p>For owner Zabu Mutua, photography was just a hobby until he realized that it takes just one person with a dream to become successful. Although ModelSensation has been around for 3 years, they face the challenge that the complexity of even the most modest project requires organization and structure. Image is everything in the modeling world, and ModelSensation strives to always be professional and not miss opportunities due to a lack of foresight.<\/p>"

Local and national speakers contributed to three main events: a talk by Drew Curtis, founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://fark.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fark.com<\/a>, the Open 2.0: Transparency and Open Access to Information lecture series, and a mobile application development course, run by Awesome Inc. and APAX Software.<\/p>\n<p>Organizers Kakie Urch and Konstantin Tovstiadi&rsquo;s goal was to bring together the many departments on campus related to informational technology to put on an event that would give them visibility and form connections with other departments and disciplines. The event was not just for UK faculty and students though.<\/p>\n<p>Attendee David McGee, a member of <a href=\"http://openlexington.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenLexington<\/a>, was interested in the topics covered in the Open 2.0 series, such as open government and open entrepreneurship. While the specific areas of openness were varied, each is relevant to Lexington, as openness continues to be in public discourse and more people have access to mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>One of the speakers was Bambi Francisco, founder and CEO of <a href=\"http://vator.tv/\" target=\"_blank\">Vator.tv<\/a>, from San Francisco. She said, &ldquo;Tech Week brought together some insightful speakers. It was well worth the trip out.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Some of the speakers led thought provoking discussions, like Urch and Chase Southard, and others gave advice, like successful entrepreneurs Francisco and Ezra Rozien. There were also many informative lectures to educate the audience about openness, such as Willey answering questions on open source software and Gorman explaining how the human sensor net can be used in disasters like the earthquake in Haiti. Molinaro and Zook&rsquo;s presentations had faculty from library and information science department so that UK can began to implement open libraries and open geography.<\/p>\n<p>Next year, Urch and Tovstiadi plan to make Tech Week bigger, while keeping the appeal of a smaller audience. The mobile app development class will be followed up by two new courses at UK in Content Management Systems and Mobile App Development.

It is an amazing opportunity to connect with other passionate and skilled individuals. Three days may not seem like a long enough time to turn your ideas into a reality. And maybe it&rsquo;s not, but that&rsquo;s the point. The whole purpose of the three days is to keep you from just talking about their ideas; we want you to actually do something about them. Instead of brainstorming about your business, create it.<\/p>\n<p>Startup Weekend 2010 will be held November 19-21st at Awesome Inc.

It has all the features of APOonline, but it is customizable to each organization. Organizations can fill out their information on the website and within the week they&rsquo;ll have a website that can be used externally for recruiting and internally for organization. It is different from other companies offering this service because it focuses on national level organization; GreekTrack.com provides the administration with live data and statistics on individual chapters or groups.Schmidt created APOonline when he was president of his APO chapter of over 140 members at UK. His goal was to streamline meetings and promote larger membership so that they could provide more service to the community. APOonline has since spread to over fifty other chapters and sections.<\/p>\n<p>Watch a short video on Tony and APOonline from the Lexington Venture Club Who Got The Money 2010.<\/p>\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BkI0DZ_BLbk?rel=0\" width=\"420\"><\/iframe><\/p>"

Also, their customer changes every four years. They consider their biggest accomplishment to be pitching their idea to Facebook and being immediately rejected.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>IN2LEX hosts the Startup Advantage lecture series the first Wednesday of the month. This month&rsquo;s speaker was Kelley Sloane, former VP of Marketing for Exstream Software.<\/p>\n<p>Sloane received a computer science degree from UK and then spent the next seven years in Information Systems at GE Lighting in Cleveland, followed by nine years in various IT product management and marketing positions at another GE business and a couple of software businesses in the Washington D.C. area. After that she returned to Lexington to be VP of Marketing at Exstream. She was Director of Enterprise Software Marketing at Hewlett Packard for two years after they acquired Exstream. Then she started her own consulting business, Sloane Marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Exstream was founded in 1998 by Davis Marksbury and Dan Kloiber. Their product was a single software system that allows large companies to create any type of mission-critical communication for their millions of customers (e.g. bills, statements, letters, etc.) in half the time it previously took, replacing many systems and processes, all while making each customer document completely personalized with relevant offers and messages. The customized document can then easily be delivered to customers according to their preferred channel, email, over the web, via mail, or all of the above. By 2008, the company had 500+ enterprise customers around the world, 314 employees, and close to 100 million dollars in annual revenue. Exstream was a privately held company, but it&rsquo;s rumored that HP acquired them for almost a billion dollars.<\/p>\n<p>The relationship and uniquely compatible partnership Marksbury and Kloiber had was key in building Exstream&rsquo;s success. Exstream was their third company together. They did not fund Exstream with venture capital, but with their own money from the sale of their previous two companies. Since it was their money, they made sure it was spent with care, telling employees that asking for a nickel was equivalent to asking for a dollar. Also, many employees had stock options so were well-incented to ensure Exstream succeeded.<\/p>\n<p>Another major contributor to Exstream&rsquo;s success was its total devotion to customer satisfaction. Marksbury and Kloiber had many successful customers from years in the industry with their first two companies, and several of those customers became Exstream early adopters. They didn&rsquo;t want to just sell to customers, they wanted customers to be so satisfied that they would become evangelists for the software. Sloane pointed out that the most important influencers on potential buyers are other customers, not marketing brochures or ads.<\/p>\n<p>Sloane says, &ldquo;success doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight.&rdquo; Her advice is to focus on building strong relationships with customers, making them part of the solution, and staying focused on your objectives and core values. She also said to spend a lot of time up front planning and setting measurable goals, because &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t manage what you can&rsquo;t measure. Execution is a lot easier when you&rsquo;re organized.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>The inauguration ceremony for the first inducted class of the <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneurhof.com/\" target=\"_blank\">KY Entrepreneur Hall of Fame<\/a> was exceptionally inspirational for a number of reasons. We had wonderful introductions from some of the HoF team, a fantastic keynote speaker in <a href=\"http://www.dippindots.com/company/\" target=\"_blank\">Curt Jones<\/a>, and just the presence of such exceptional people was enough to inspire anyone to go out and try to execute on their dream. These things, though, were not a surprise. We had planned them all, expected them to have this effect. What we did not expect was that the event would last almost twice as long as we had planned by very fortunate accident. The acceptance speeches of our inductees invariably turned into stories of their early days, reflections on where their journeys had begun, and it was these stories that were the most moving, educational, and entertaining aspect of the evening by far.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the crowd was limited to only 70 people, and this is something we wanted to change with the Founders Series interviews. The Founders Series interviews is a project put on by the Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame. Its goal is to share the stories of its inductees and other notable entrepreneurs in the Commonwealth in order to educate and inspire others to pursue equally ambitious and courageous endeavors.<\/p>\n<p>We will be releasing the Founders Series interviews one at a time starting in spring 2011. For now, here are some photos from the interviews.<\/p>"

What better way to learn about entrepreneurship than to start a company? The students participated in a miniature <a href=\"http://lexington.startupweekend.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Weekend<\/a> at Awesome Inc that culminated with each team developing a tear sheet for their startup (also knows as a one pager). The day began with listening to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1QWtgPgqZg\" target=\"_blank\">The Song<\/a> (Numb/Encore by JayZ/ Linkin Park), <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5YJfPBqPNE\" target=\"_blank\">The Other Song<\/a> (Remember the Name by Fort Minor), and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMt8ZYaJKmA\" target=\"_blank\">#3<\/a> (Go it Alone by Beck) for inspiration. Next there was an introduction on what entrepreneurship is and what it takes to start a company.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of the day was to develop a one pager on the company they decided to launch. After reviewing what a one pager is, they learned how important it is to pick the right people with whom to work. They wrote down each person&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses to help them choose team members who would complement their own strengths and weaknesses.<\/p>\n<p>Next the students called out ideas for companies. Of the fifteen proposed ideas, the students narrowed it down to three and then chose which idea they wanted to work on. After developing their ideas and learning how to use Google docs, each team created a one pager. Check out their one pagers below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Forget Me Not- Madelyn Culbertson, Jamie Harvener, Janey Scott<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"forget me not\" height=\"216\" src=\"http://awesomeinc.org/images/showcase/277x216xforget_me_not.jpg.pagespeed.ic.hcA7HlTDWc.jpg\" title=\"team 1\" width=\"277\"/><a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/images/ForgetMeNot.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Forget Me Not one pager\" height=\"330\" src=\"http://awesomeinc.org/images/showcase/Forget_Me_Not_one_pager.png\" title=\"Forget Me Not\" width=\"290\"/><\/a><strong>DayHolster- Stephen Parsons, Nick Such, Evan Chethik, Tony Vivanco (not pictured)<\/strong><img alt=\"DayHolster\" height=\"216\" src=\"http://awesomeinc.org/images/showcase/DayHolster.jpg\" title=\"team 3\" width=\"277\"/><a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/images/DayHolster.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"DayHolster one pager\" height=\"330\" src=\"http://awesomeinc.org/images/showcase/DayHolster_one_pager.png\" title=\"DayHolster\" width=\"290\"/><\/a><strong>Bargain Hunter- Darius Clay, Clint Bacon, Todd Montgomery<\/strong><img alt=\"bargain hunter\" height=\"208\" src=\"http://awesomeinc.org/images/showcase/bargain_hunter.JPG\" title=\"team 2\" width=\"277\"/><\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>I recently reached out to Paul Graham to inquire about speaking at a mobile tech conference Awesome Inc is hosting called <a href=\"http://www.mobilexconference.com/\" target=\"_blank\">mobileX<\/a>. For those who don&rsquo;t know, Paul Graham is the founder of <a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Y-Combinator<\/a>. He&rsquo;s like the Chris Berman (ESPN) of sports, but for tech startups. Some call him the Godfather. Ok, I&rsquo;m probably putting him on way more of a pedestal than I should, but he is on our <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/2010/03/23/rockstars/\" target=\"_blank\">wall of rockstars<\/a> at Awesome Inc. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://takeitupalevel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/pg1.jpeg\" title=\"Paul Graham - wall pic\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Paul Graham - wall pic\" height=\"320\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/tomiogeron/files/2011/08/Paulgraham_240x320.jpg\" title=\"Paul Graham - wall pic\" width=\"240\"/><\/a>He responded within 24 hours with this note: &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m so busy with YC that I am trying to avoid almost all events, pg.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Sweet! He told me no! This is great news. Now I can move onto to trying to find another speaker. He didn&rsquo;t tell me, maybe. He didn&rsquo;t tell me he&rsquo;d think about it. He didn&rsquo;t tell me to go jump through some unnecessary hoops and then he&rsquo;d get back with me. He knew the answer and very politely told me he couldn&rsquo;t do it. <br/><br/>If only this happened more often. Let&rsquo;s take another every day example from my life. I play indoor soccer and usually I&rsquo;m the poor soul that is left organizing the team. This means ensuring that we have enough players show up to each game. Every week I send out texts to the entire team asking if they can make it or not. Getting a quick response is as likely as getting my girlfriend to quickly leave the mall. I could swear that sometimes you&rsquo;d think people are so hesitant to tell me they can&rsquo;t make it that it&rsquo;s like they are delivering the news that my grandmother has passed away. Just tell me no, people! Tell me no right away and I can find a sub. But most of the times I find out at game time they can&rsquo;t make it so we&rsquo;re stuck shorthanded. This behavior is common with friends, business partners, employees, mentors and customers. <br/><br/>I remember trying to raise a round of investment a year-and-a-half ago. Every investor we would pitch to would tell us they loved our idea and were &ldquo;probably&quot; in. At the end of each meeting they would ask us to draw up financial projections, learn how to use business planning software tools, or hold numerous additional meetings. We had one investor spend an entire meeting teaching us about all the different types of term sheets! Seriously! My company was a mobile tech startup. You want me to become an expert on term sheets and then you&rsquo;ll invest? Of course, he didn&rsquo;t invest and by the next meeting he didn&rsquo;t even bring up the importance of term sheets, even though we had researched them extensively. We had other investors tell us they would &quot;definitely&quot; do something with us. A week later, they wouldn&rsquo;t return our phone calls. The point is - I don&rsquo;t mind learning business planning software or learning about term sheets, but let&rsquo;s be honest, these are hoops that you are having me jump through to see that I can execute. And I only want to prove to you that I can execute if you are sincerely interested. If you don&rsquo;t plan to invest in the first place, please don&rsquo;t waste my time and just tell me no right away - or at least as soon as you know the answer is no.<\/p>"

MobileX is a one-day conference where attendees will engage with a multitude of prominent presenters, examine mobile solutions and learn technical concepts in mobile and related industries. Current and potential entrepreneurs, investors, developers, industry professionals and other mobile followers are invited to attend.<\/p>\n<p>MobileX will begin after breakfast with an opening keynote presentation followed by multi-track sessions. A few examples of the specific breakout sessions are: Android beginners, mobile marketing, social media and advanced technical tracks.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most compelling parts of MobileX is the start up pitch contest. This is an exceptional chance for contestants to concisely advocate any start-up idea or business they may have created related to the mobile sector.<\/p>\n<p>Competitors are allotted five minutes to pitch their idea to a panel of judges. Afterwards, a three-minute session of Q&amp;A is held with the judges and if time allows, with the audience. Those competing are allowed to use slides or present a demo, but it is not deemed necessary. The judging panel will offer feedback and then the audience will vote via their mobile devices. A combination of judges and audience vote will determine the winner.<\/p>\n<p>The winner will receive a 500 USD prize in PayPal cash. The competition is beneficial to all whom compete because of the constructive feedback and networking opportunities available through the experts convened at MobileX.<\/p>\n<p>WHY:<\/p>\n<p>The mobile market is skyrocketing at momentous speed. Demand for smart devices such as the Android, iPhone and Blackberry reflect a thriving market. Developers have collectively been able to cash in on this new software delivery platform to the tune of several billion dollars in sales. At the last Apple keynote event on March 2, Steve Jobs announced a payout of two billion dollars to developers for apps sold through the iTunes app store. RIM Blackberry and Google Android devices are used by millions, as well, providing competition and an innovative pace mobile users are enjoying.<\/p>\n<p>MobileX seeks to present information that will enhance overall understanding of the mobile industry. The conference will thoroughly aid in this endeavor by exploring the changes within the mobile industry itself. MobileX will also address the industries that the changes may affect directly.<\/p>\n<p>WHO AND HOW:<\/p>\n<p>MobileX will feature speakers from San Francisco, Boston, NYC, Chicago and Seattle. Among the talented queue of speakers you will hear are Lai Lau of <a href=\"http://developer.att.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T<\/a>, Brian Wong of <a href=\"http://kiip.me/\" target=\"_blank\">kiip.me<\/a>, Nihal Mehta of <a href=\"http://buzzd.com/\" target=\"_blank\">buzzd<\/a>, Sam Soffes of <a href=\"http://scribd.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scribd<\/a>, and Praveen Alavilli from <a href=\"http://www.x.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PayPalX<\/a>, plus leaders in mobile marketing, social media, and entrepreneurship.

Sam Soffes, originally from Louisville, is all of the above and working towards more.<\/p>\n<p>Soffes did not attend college and says that it was the best decision ever. Curiously, Steve Jobs said the same thing about college and has obviously found success in a multitude of diverse of areas. Soffes seems to be heading in the same direction with the success of a few start-up businesses and an iPhone app (<a href=\"http://www.youversion.com/mobile/iphone\" target=\"_blank\">Bible<\/a>) that currently has over 8 million downloads.<\/p>\n<p>As far as inspiration, he&rsquo;s a regular guy: Twitter and other well-crafted apps are what give him inspiration for creativity and development. He claims that great ideas usually find him in the shower or while he is biking to work.<\/p>\n<p>Soffes has produced music that is definitely worth checking out. He is part of the band <a href=\"http://findingchesterfield.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Finding Chesterfield<\/a>which released an EP A Three Day Walk in October 2010. He also has a few independent works available for free listening pleasure on his blog. As far as music influences and favorites go, his <a href=\"http://last.fm/\" target=\"_blank\">last.fm<\/a> radio station ranges from Owl City and The Dangerous Summer to Ben Folds and Blink 182.<\/p>\n<p>In a year or two, he plans on starting another company. One can only guess what magnificent results his next endeavor will foster, but with his previous work being of such quality, success is imminent.

Congratulations Shawn! The audience winner (decided via text message) was Double The Fun. Congratulations, Rachel, Breanne, Lindsay, and Celeste. You did a great job.<\/p>\n<p>All the pitches were great! We&rsquo;re sure the judges had a hard time making their decision. Thanks to everyone who came out in support of this event.

      "regular-title": "Talking out loud is a valuable thing - MobileX in review",
      "regular-body": "<p>Now for the value to me personally I&rsquo;ve realized that any time I&rsquo;m invited to lead a breakout session or speak to other entrepreneurs it forces me to step back and recalibrate my thoughts and attitudes. This helps me make sure I still believe in what we are doing and how we are doing it.<\/p>\n<p>My take away from this engagement was the re-confirmation that being refreshingly transparent about what is and isn&rsquo;t in your business is key. In the startup world you see some of the best bizdev people you&rsquo;re ever going to see. Sometimes too good. All too often you see a great speaker with magical points on how to lead people to success. The problem is often time these guys are really exaggerating what really exists in their business. I won&rsquo;t call them lies exactly so much as exaggerations that lead to disappointment. So is this wrong? I&rsquo;m not so sure. It is a fine line bizdev people walk.<\/p>\n<p>My solution? I try to be as transparent as possible. For example, during this talk I made it clear that we are not out of the woods yet. Just because you take some form of funding, get media attention, or hire people, doesn&rsquo;t mean your company is a success. This is another point I like to share with would-be startup guys: what is the end game? In fact, I often ask this of people we hire at Mavizon. If the end game is to raise 10 million in capital then retire as soon as you can, you probably need a wake up call. In <a href=\"http://37signals.com/rework/\" target=\"_blank\">Rework<\/a> they call it a commitment strategy. I think it is more of a reality plan. I love to dream as much as the next guy, but if you think retiring on a yacht is the goal you&rsquo;re nutty. What would these people do on a yacht for the last 70 years of their life.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Hamman\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://mobilexconference.com/speakers/hamman.jpg\" width=\"150\"/><\/p>\n<p><em>I thought it might be a good thing to gather my thoughts from the MobileX conference I spoke at a few weeks ago in Lexington, KY. MobileX is a gathering of mobile startups, investors, idea guys, coders, etc., to talk about lessons learned, how-tos, and what&rsquo;s next in the mobile space. The event was started in Lexington by Awesome Inc., an incubator/co-work space.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The MobileX conference was fairly successful for all involved. For the hosts, they enjoyed a large crowd, a decent local media flow, and even a few Lexington big wigs stopped in. As for the attendees, well they enjoyed some great breakout sessions from <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/brian_wong\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Wong<\/a>, CEO of <a href=\"http://kiip.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Kiip.me<\/a>, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/nihalmehta\" target=\"_blank\">Nihal Mehta<\/a>, CEO of<a href=\"http://localresponse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">localresponse.com<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/samsoffes\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Soffees<\/a>, engineer at <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scribd.com<\/a>. Any person with an ounce of drive in them I&rsquo;m sure was inspired and fired up to get out of the conference to build something.<\/p>\n\n<p>I like business. It is like a drug. If one business fails, or succeeds, I&rsquo;m sure everyone at Mavizon will be looking for whats next and that&rsquo;s a very cool thing.<\/p>\n<p>As I shared these thoughts at the mobile conference, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how they would be received from a group of people with dollar signs in their eyes talking to VCs. I was pleasantly surprised when a number of people approached me and wanted to talk. I hope they gained some value from the ideas shared, but the fact is there is no rule book. If anybody had the right answers, we&rsquo;d have a lot more successful startups. That is about where I ended with the talk, and I&rsquo;ll do the same with this post, treat your business like an art. Art doesn&rsquo;t have rules and neither does startup culture. Even so, everyone seems to know good art when they see it.<\/p>"

Most importantly, attendees went home with fresh ideas, relationships started, and a sense of what’s next in mobile.<\/p>\n<p>Brian Wong, twenty years and one day old, capped his week off by delivering the MobileX keynote. His week had begun with the launch of his new VC-backed company, <a href=\"http://kiip.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Kiip<\/a>. Wong talked about what he calls “the emotional startup” &ndash; a company geared at offering something beyond technological sophistication. Kiip is making an effort at bringing the magic of the moment to the gaming ad space, previously devoid of emotional connection. Citing examples of Guy Kawasaki, author of <em>Enchantment<\/em>, and Tony Hsieh, author of <em>Delivering Happiness<\/em>, Brian Wong emphasized that companies must now feel, or die.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"160\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5229/5625844822_5b5e16ed17_m.jpg\" title=\"Brian Wong\" width=\"240\"/>Keynote Brian Wong<br/><\/p>\n<p>One of the crowd-favorite speakers was Josh Bob of <a href=\"http://textaurant.com/\" target=\"_blank\">textaurant.com<\/a>.

Cory Doctorow describes the idea of whuffie in his book &ldquo;Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom&rdquo;. Whuffie is the currency of social influence. Since anyone can use social media, we all have the power of influence. But just like any relationships, the ones created by social media take time to develop, so don&rsquo;t be too over eager to close the deal too soon.<\/p>\n<p>McGee provided tips for using social media successfully. It is important to always have owned media. A business should always direct their social media back to a website they own, so as things like Myspace come and go, they still have a place for costumers to find them.<\/p>\n<p>Another tip is to avoid automation, as it causes some things to be lost in translation. You can link sites like Facebook and Twitter so posting on one automatically posts to the other, but you lose the nuances of both. For example, on Twitter there is a hashtag #MM, which means Music Monday. Facebook users may not be familiar with the meaning, so it is not good idea for that tweet to be posted on Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, for people not sure how to use Twitter, there are two good ways to get started. Both are meant to get the user invested in using and checking his or her Twitter. The first method is to following interesting people you don&rsquo;t know and try to get them to respond to you. The second is to find three friends you care about on Twitter and respond back and forth with them.<\/p>\n<p>Using social media can be a great tool for a business to interact with customers. It is easy to do by keeping a few tips in mind. David McGee can be reached <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/@davemc9ee\" target=\"_blank\">@davemc9ee<\/a>.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>The June 22nd 5 Across event was yet another success (see <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/www.5across.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.5across.org<\/a>). The 5 pitches were:<\/p>\n<p>Matt Fulton, pitched The Clubhouse, which is designed to provide the golf community with an outlet to play golf during the winter/rainy off-season and nighttime, or other times when traditional golf is not an option. In addition, The Clubhouse will provide a casual environment to eat sophisticated yet uncomplicated food with alcohol service and access to televised sporting events.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Glowb\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5236/5889005832_0842bb1dfa.jpg\" width=\"200\"/>Laurel Christensen, pitched the Glowb, a self-contained night light that projects patterns on surrounding surfaces, instantly transforming the space which it is in. It is a 20-sided geometric solid, an icosahedron, with a pattern cut out of each face. It is powered by 4 AA batteries which can be easily changed by opening one of the faces.<\/p>\n<p>Jeffrey Lorch, pitched The Green Giant which is a portable, solar/diesel hybrid power station. The multi-functional power generating station features a 24 VDC power train which more efficiently generates energy, requiring less to operate, thus making it&rsquo;s primary solar source much more feasible. It uses a hybrid power system utilizing two solar panels and a diesel fueled Auxiliary Power Unit . The Green Giant can also play a significant role in disaster relief operations as it can simultaneously illuminate a search area, pump air/oxygen into a location should a victim be found, and communicate via video and/or cellular to operation centers while the victim is being extricated.<\/p>\n<p>Ben Freeman and Tyler Yarbrough, pitched Betabase, which is a first person, high definition video guidebook of popular rock climbing routes throughout the country starting with the Red River Gorge as a test piece. From these videos, they can also create 3D panoramic maps of rock faces using the still images which can be manipulated by climbers who want to study their projects at their leisure.<\/p>\n<p>Eric Hartman, pitched The ACLerator, which is a physical therapy device for the sports medicine / rehabilitation market. The device is intended for muscle strengthening during post-surgical knee immobilization following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR) or Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA).<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Eric Hartman\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5303/5888480929_f7247edb95_z.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>The winner decided by the judges was Eric Hartman, with The ACLerator. Congratulations Eric! The audience winner (decided via text message) was Laurel Christensen, with the Glowb. Congratulations Laurel. Your Glowb lights were awesome! <\/p>\n<p>All the pitches were great! We&rsquo;re sure the judges had a hard time making their decision. Thanks to everyone who came out in support of this event. We were happy to see you and hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. If you missed the event, you can see videos of the pitches at 5across.org. We hope to see you at the August 24th event!<\/p>"

Others might travel, visit with family, or take summer classes. For seven Lexington students, this summer has been spent starting companies out of Awesome Inc.<\/p>\n<p>Team Alpha, Awesome Inc&rsquo;s incredible team of high-performing interns, saw an influx of talent throughout the late spring and early summer. To accommodate this wave of talent, Awesome Inc launched a summer program called Team Alpha X - a miniature start-up accelerator program for young and aspiring entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into companies over the course of a summer. In essence, it&rsquo;s a boot camp for entrepreneurs. The program includes a rigorous schedule of mentor sessions, project management planning meetings, pitch preparation, and product development. By the end of the program, the teams are expected to have an alpha version of their product launched, a subset of customers using their product, and a pitch deck ready to show off to future customers and investors.<\/p>\n<p>Team Alpha X is emulated after successful accelerator programs such as <a href=\"http://www.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">YCombinator<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.techstars.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Techstars<\/a>, headquarted in San Francisco, CA and Boulder, CO respectively.

      "regular-body": "<p>Adults over 21in the Lexington area looking to participate in casual recreational sports leagues and socialize with fellow patrons now have a chance to do so thanks to the Lexington Sports and Social Club.<\/p>\n<p>Karl Beisel, founder of the Lexington Sports and Social Club, got his vision for the locally based club up and running in the fall of 2010. Since then, the Lexington Sports and Social Club has averaged around 300 athletes per season.<\/p>\n<p>The sports rotate based on the season. League seasons are eight weeks long; include a preseason party at a local sponsoring bar and a single elimination playoff for qualifying teams.<\/p>\n<p>After games, which are once a week, players have the option to socialize at a bar close to the game. The given bar for that particular week sponsors an event for league members after their games.<\/p>\n<p>“The bars sponsor us,” Beisel said. “They (the bars) are located near the fields (which vary based on sport.) We look at a few different options and talk to the owners about getting us discounts and specials,” …“It’s different from other leagues because it’s not just a team, it’s about the whole league – you get to know people from the whole league, we all go to the same bar. In traditional leagues, it’s about the competition and interacting purely with your own team. We’re focused on getting everybody together.”<\/p>\n<p>Hybrid athletes can join but competition isn’t purely what the club is based upon.<\/p>\n<p>“We draw a lot from nontraditional athletes; the sports are an excuse to socialize,” … “There are some existing clubs a like but we focus more on adult socializing,” Beisel said.<\/p>\n<p>Users participate in a league by creating an account on the website, <a href=\"http://www.lexssc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.lexssc.com/<\/a>, and picking which sport(s) they want to participate in for the season. Each league is $49. <\/p>\n<p>Users then have the option of creating their own team and inviting people to play, requesting to join a team or being placed on a team based on need. There are also teams that consist of all newly joined members.  Every team is co-ed and has a minimum/maximum for each gender.<\/p>\n<p>Sports being offered this fall are kickball, flag football and dodge ball.<\/p>\n<p>The deadline for flag football is Sept. 19; the deadline for dodge ball is Oct. 4. The deadline for kickball has passed but people interested can still join after paying a $10 late registration fee. <\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><strong>Part 1 – Commitment – Getting in the Door<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why you haven&rsquo;t achieved huge entrepreneurial success, despite following all the rules and doing everything &ldquo;right&rdquo;, my guess is that it&rsquo;s because you probably haven&rsquo;t asked for it.<\/p>\n<p>You haven&rsquo;t stepped out there and asked for a huge order from a potential new customer, tried to sign up a premier supplier, gone up to that wealthy investor to ask for funding, or, as Sir Richard Branson did in his 20&rsquo;s, make an offer on a piece of real estate that&rsquo;s twenty five times more expensive than you can afford. However, it&rsquo;s only through asking that you ultimately get that customer, that supplier, that investor&hellip;or that Caribbean Island.<\/p>\n<p>In this three part series we&rsquo;ll see what we can learn about how to &lsquo;ask big&rsquo; the right way from the story of Richard&rsquo;s purchase of Necker Island over 30 years ago, and from personal examples of my own entrepreneurial journey.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s 1978 and Richard Branson is 28 years old. It&rsquo;s been seven years since he opened his first record shop on Oxford street in downtown London and things are going well. He hears that some of the British Virgin Islands are for sale so he jumps on a jet and heads out there to check them out.<\/p>\n<p>Stop.<\/p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a lesson for us to learn here already:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson #1: If you&rsquo;re going to ask for something and expect to be heard, you have to put yourself in the right place. This takes commitment.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Getting in the door is hard - you can&rsquo;t do it by timidly sticking your toe in there – you have to knock and knock and knock and when you get a crack you have to stand in the doorway with your whole body.<\/p>\n<p>If Richard had heard about the availability of the islands, looked them up in a magazine, and called a couple owners to see if they would work with him on the price, do you think they would have given him the time of day? Of course not.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is Richard Branson Teaching Us?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Without hesitation, Richard flew across the second largest body of water on earth to go check these islands out. That&rsquo;s several days and several hundred dollars worth of commitment just to see if he was interested. It also put him in a position where he could make a phone call to the owners and say &ldquo;I flew out to your island and looked over it thoroughly. I&rsquo;d like to discuss it with you.&rdquo; That will get a seller&rsquo;s attention..<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, if you want to do business with Coca-Cola you can&rsquo;t send them an email and expect a positive response, or probably a response at all.<\/p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb when trying to decide if you&rsquo;re putting yourself in the right place or not: If it takes less than an hour of your time to prepare for and make the ask (i.e. phone call, letter, email) then that means it&rsquo;s just as easy for someone else to do the same, so think outside the box. Spend the money and time necessary to put yourself in a position where you&rsquo;ll be heard. Be committed to it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>My Story: Getting in the Door at Facebook<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I started a small company that exchanged textbooks at local universities while I was in college. In 2006, when Facebook was only a couple years old (we were about the same age), and was only expanding one university campus at a time (a strategy we were employing as well) we wanted to get acquired by Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>We were a tiny company compared to Facebook so we knew that we&rsquo;d have to do something drastic to actually talk to someone there and really be listened to. We spent weeks trying to find friends of friends or connections of some kind to someone that worked at Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>I finally found the blog of someone there. He was the product manager for Facebook mobile - the first version of Facebook on your cellular phone. I called him out of the blue and told him I would be in town for a conference and wanted to meet him (the conference was about women entrepreneurs and it was free&hellip; and he was putting it on - it was just an excuse to go out there and not sound so obviously desperate).<\/p>\n<p>Then our company proceeded to spend the next few weeks putting together screenshots of what our service would look like if integrated into Facebook so we could show him how smoothly it could work. I&rsquo;ll never forget sleeping in the university library through the night making these screenshots.<\/p>\n<p>We then spent almost all the profit we had ever made to fly me out there, rent a car, etc. But I got face to face time with this Facebook employee. He listened to everything I had to say, and even though he told me that it would never be something that Facebook would be interested in, I got his attention and won his respect. Something I never would have done without all the commitment necessary to get and prepare for this meeting.<\/p>\n<p>As a side note - this paid off later when I launched a series of mobile phone technology conferences, and guess who our keynote speaker was at all the conferences, talking about their experience with Facebook mobile?<\/p>\n<p>What do you do once you actually get the opportunity to &ldquo;Ask Big&rdquo;? We&rsquo;ll go back to Richard&rsquo;s Necker Island story, and then to a story of one of my friends&rsquo; attempts at a million dollar deal with Samsung to answer that question in the next <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/how-richard-branson-bought-an-island-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">post<\/a>.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><strong>Part 2 – Courage – Asking Like You Mean It<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a continuation from <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/how-richard-branson-bought-an-island-part-1\" target=\"_blank\">part 1<\/a>.<strong><br/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Richard&rsquo;s story<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Richard had discovered that some of the British Virgin Islands are for sale. He went on holiday to visit them and see if he&rsquo;d like to purchase one, despite not having nearly enough money to afford one.<\/p>\n<p>After a handful of beautiful but not life-changing visits to other islands, Richard landed on Necker Island, 74 acres of dense, lush foliage, wildlife, uninterrupted beach all around and a hill in the middle that allows you to see the whole island from one place. He fell in love with it<\/p>\n<p>He returned to the helicopter after a trip around the island and asked about the seller and the price. The seller turned out to be Lord Cobham and the price $5,000,000.<\/p>\n<p>Now, to many people that would have been the bubble-bursting moment. After all, Virgin still owed banks thousands of dollars. But it didn&rsquo;t slow Richard down; he was too excited and too convinced that he would find a way to get that island. So he started by making a bid&hellip;.of $100,000 (that&rsquo;s 98% less than the asking price, by the way).<\/p>\n<p>Not only was he turned down but he was immediately forced to leave the island! However, upon his return to England, he continued to negotiate and to raise the money he needed to pay for the island.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson #2: When you ask, ask like you mean it - and really mean it. This takes courage.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Richard knew he was making a ridiculous offer. He knew it was so low that it would upset the owner. But that didn&rsquo;t keep him from negotiating from a place of absolute sincerity and courage.You not only have to put yourself in a place where you will be heard, you have to make an ask that you are sincere about - no matter how ridiculous the other side might think it is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>My Story: Having the Courage to ask Samsung for One Million Dollars<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have a friend that runs a creative advertising company. He was going to do a deal with Samsung about building Times Square in Second Life. At the time there were millions of active users on Second Life (an online 3D virtual reality world that mimicked the physical world) and the idea was that once Samsung had my friend&rsquo;s company build Times Square, they would be able to control the advertising on it (just like the real Times Square).<\/p>\n<p>My friend sat down at the table with the CEO of Samsung, in their office in New York City, looked him straight in the eye and said &ldquo;We will build this for you for $1,000,000.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The CEO came back with an offer of $25,000. My friend didn&rsquo;t budge – even though his company only had three people in it and had been around for just three years. The tension in the room was high. The CEO refused to get anywhere near my friend&rsquo;s bid and vice versa.<\/p>\n<p>At this point you might be thinking: &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s Samsung and you&rsquo;re just a small business. You should jump at the opportunity because they are such a well known company!&rdquo; But my friend wasn&rsquo;t kidding when he asked for that $1,000,000; he really believed that his service was worth that much. Whether you or Samsung agree with this line of reasoning doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is that my friend felt this way and stuck to it&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>&hellip;and walked away from the deal completely. He told Samsung no.<\/p>\n<p>A few months later he ended up doing an innovative project with Ford Motor Company for full price.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Richard and My Advertising Friend are Teaching Us<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Whether you are &lsquo;asking big&rsquo; out of principle like my friend, or because it&rsquo;s all you have to work with, like Richard, the point is that you have to be serious. You have to mean it. You have to stick to it if you want to maintain mutual respect in the deal. That&rsquo;s not to say you can&rsquo;t get creative, but you need to know what you are going to ask and why before you open your mouth.<\/p>\n<p>If you were to get 15 minutes of Bill Gates&rsquo;s time to pitch him your software product would you finish and then offer to sell it to him for $10,000,000, even if that is 100 times more than you&rsquo;ve ever charged anyone? If you were trying to talk Sony into becoming a supplier at your retail store and you finally got an offer from them, would you be willing to ask for 50% off and mean it if you thought it was the right thing to do?<\/p>\n<p>Asking big and meaning it takes courage, but why? Most people would say it&rsquo;s because the person or company might say no. That might be part of it, but I think it&rsquo;s not the most important part. The thing that I think scares us the most and therefore forces us to summon more courage than we think we can, is what you would be called upon to do if the other side actually says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to your request.<\/p>\n<p>In the third part of this series we&rsquo;ll be looking at the final piece of Richard&rsquo;s Necker Island story as well as the story of how I ended up being homeless for most of 2009 and 2010.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><img src=\"http://wordscience.vpweb.com/bg-1.gif?u=3108536620\" width=\"590\"/><\/p>\n<p>Many believe that the science of marketing often comes down to an effective communication process that is easily interpreted and understood which, in turn, increases sales due to a clearly delivered/received message. WordScience is the messenger waiting to deliver your message.<\/p>\n<p>WordScience is a content marketing firm owned and managed by a veteran in the marketing/public relations sector who has over 25 years experience in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>Carro Ford is the face behind the brand. Ford, a graduate of Spring Hill College in Mobile, Ala., began her career in bank marketing, and then moved to the marketing communications branch at a technology company. She has been involved in technology ever since.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I got my first jobs in marketing,&rdquo; Ford said. &ldquo;I went into bank marketing and then I got into technology, which is where I&rsquo;ve been ever since. I&rsquo;ve always been in marketing and communications.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>WordScience, based out of Lexington, Ky., specializes in content marketing and copywriting. Services offered include press releases, case studies, articles, blogs, web copy, white papers, brochures, presentations and backgrounders.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mostly involved in PR and the copywriting part of marketing &hellip; I write content. And then for some clients I help them get it placed in trade journals. I don&rsquo;t deal with the consumer press. There are many aspects of PR, there&rsquo;s corporate PR, which is where I am, and I specialize in my own niche,&rdquo; Ford said.<\/p>\n<p>Ford&rsquo;s clientele base is wide and ranges from Kentucky to Europe. Describing her business as an outsourced marketing firm, she gets her clientele base mostly from word of mouth and referrals. Ford&rsquo;s clientele base is mostly, but not limited to, software companies.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my sweet spot,&rdquo; Ford said of the software companies. &ldquo;To take it a little further, it&rsquo;s the marketing director at those companies that either has too many projects and not enough bandwidth, or they don&rsquo;t have a marketing person and the CEO does it on the side. Those are the kind of people that I find are the best clients for me.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>She added that sometimes companies don&rsquo;t know what kind of marketing they need and that they want her to tell them what (marketing) they need because they don&rsquo;t know where to start. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re kind of an outsourced marketing department. That&rsquo;s exactly the model I&rsquo;m trying to work toward,&rdquo; Ford said.<\/p>\n<p>After spending time in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, Ford, a Louisville native, decided it was time to come back to Kentucky and be around her family. She would eventually branch away from the corporate world and launch her company, WordScience.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been doing it (running her business) for 12 years. I lived elsewhere after I left Mobile (which is where she attended college). I went to Pennsylvania then North Carolina, then I had a chance to come back to Kentucky, which is where all my family was, and at the time I thought it would be a good thing to do, and it was,&rdquo; Ford said. &ldquo;So I came back and worked for a company in town for about a year and I had an opportunity to pick up some side jobs and I realized, after running my numbers, that if I picked up a few more I could support myself. So I kept on growing the business from there. There&rsquo;s a lot of work out there for free lance marketers.<\/p>\n<p>&quot;I had a really good network in the industry. The corporate jobs I had were in the same industry so my contacts go way back. I started with a couple of clients, some I&rsquo;ve had for about ten years. They&rsquo;re some of my original clients &hellip; that helped me move along,&rdquo; Ford said.<\/p>\n<p>Despite success in the field, Ford never envisioned owning her own company.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It just happened. I never had a goal of doing it when I was in the corporate world. It just kept going and going and I realized I could do this,&rdquo; Ford said.<\/p>\n<p>As the digital age of marketing and technology continues to grow from where it was years ago, marketing content and reach-ability has also matured.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;That (the digital age of marketing) has made what I bring to clients richer. I can offer clients so much more,&rdquo; Ford said. &ldquo;Marketing is so different than from when I started, I think it&rsquo;s really exciting today to be a marketer and in PR.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Visit Ford&rsquo;s website at <a href=\"http://www.wordscience.net/\" target=\"_blank\">wordscience.net.<\/a> To contact Carro, dial (859) 771-5091 and/or email her at carrof@earthlink.net.<\/p>"

      "regular-title": "4 Reasons Why Lee Todd is Awesome",
      "regular-body": "<p>&ldquo;Dude, I just had a five hour energy and then took a 20 minute nap&hellip;I&rsquo;m going to shake his hand right off of his arm!&rdquo; Brian and I were waiting for Dr. Todd to show up at Arby&rsquo;s for lunch. Awesome Labs Director, Nick Such, was on his way. We&rsquo;d been wanting to meet with him since before we opened the doors of Awesome Inc, as we feel it&rsquo;s making the kind of differences that Dr. Todd talks about in his speeches, but for one reason or another we had yet to get to sit down with him and hear him express his personal priorities, and us ours. So in addition to my physiologically stimulated state and my naturally high-energy personality, waiting three years to sit down with someone that you&rsquo;ve got a picture of on your wall (actually in two places - our &lsquo;Wall of Awesome&rsquo; and &rsquo;<a href=\"http://www.entrepreneurhof.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame<\/a>&rsquo;), had me ridiculously excited.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately for all parties involved, Dr. Todd&rsquo;s hand stayed attached to his forearm after I shook it. I was also able to sit still long enough to hear all the cool things he had done and Brian, Nick and I shared what had done and planned to accomplish with Awesome Inc. As the conversation wrapped up, though, I was even more energized than when it started, actually more so than I&rsquo;d been in months and not because Dr. Todd gave us advice or insight that we&rsquo;d never heard, or made an introduction for us that we needed. He made no promises and offered no favors (aside from covering our lunch - which we greatly appreciated), just his presence and attention for a little over an hour. In this post, I want to explain how that presence and attention alone lifted the spirits of three young entrepreneurs in a way it hadn&rsquo;t been in a long time. The short answer: he&rsquo;s awesome.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. He cares about Awesome stuff.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Rule #4: &ldquo;Always do something awesome over something not awesome.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Dr. Todd has a passion for science, technology, entrepreneurship, math, and education. He knows that building a strong foundation in these areas will make an individual more employable, and that doing it for the state of Kentucky and the US will make us more competitive. Since he happens to be an MIT-trained engineer, entrepreneur, and educator he not only knows intellectually that everyone else should do these things, but he personally has dedicated his professional life to them, and not out of obligation. His definition of 'Awesome&rsquo; throughout his life has been different manifestations of these endeavors.<\/p>\n<p>Between Brian, Nick, and I, we are also scientists, engineers, educators, and entrepreneurs, and we see some of the same opportunities and potential for the students of UK and the people of this state and nation. We&rsquo;ve also made sacrifices for and decisions about our professional futures (<a href=\"http://takeitupalevel.com/2011/09/20/becoming-an-entrepreneur-again-and-again/\" target=\"_blank\">Brian&rsquo;s decision<\/a>, <a href=\"http://nicksuch.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/what-matters-to-you-most-and-why/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick&rsquo;s decision<\/a>, <a href=\"http://lukemurray.com/so-youre-retaking-the-year\" target=\"_blank\">my decision<\/a>) to these things as well.<\/p>\n<p>Having this common foundation, not just as a hobby (we weren&rsquo;t talking UK basketball while blowing off jobs we didn&rsquo;t like) or even as a profession (Brian, Nick, and I have yet to pay ourselves and Dr. Todd could have found a much more lucrative job if he was shooting to maximize his income), but as a deep-seated calling and passion transformed the conversation from one of just energy and passionate opinions to one of purpose. When he would tell us that he 'really appreciated what we were doing&rsquo; it was a thankfulness that felt better than most people that share this sentiment (which is many) not just because Dr. Todd&rsquo;s a big deal, but because we felt understood and validated by someone that has gone through and then so far beyond where we are.<\/p>\n<p>It was also encouraging to see that his definition of Awesome was his own, not determined by anyone else. He was saying no to so many things things that weren&rsquo;t his priority or passion and had been for years. There are plenty of things he could have focused on both in his presidency and now that he has chosen not to. This refusal to say yes to everything has led to criticism (one of Dr. Todd&rsquo;s favorite qu<\/p>\n<p>otes about how much &rsquo;<a href=\"http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trsorbonnespeech.html\" target=\"_blank\">the critic<\/a>&rsquo; counts) and a whole lot more progress towards what he thinks really matters than if he&rsquo;d tried to make everyone happy. He&rsquo;s embodied the attitude of <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/forget-emdo-your-thing\" target=\"_blank\">forget 'em - do your thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. He cares about making a difference<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Todd has created millions of dollars in wealth and hundreds of jobs through the companies he has created and sold.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>He has lead the flagship university of this state for the past decade, <em><img alt=\"Lee Todd\" height=\"170\" src=\"http://www.centre.edu/news/2011/img/lee_todd.jpg\" width=\"170\"/><\/em>reaching significant milestones while simultaneously being more and more underfunded by the state. He has unquestionably made a large contribution in the last 20 years. But even as a professor at UK 25+ years ago (which, in and of itself, is an important contribution) Dr. Todd sought to make a difference outside of the classroom. Making an impact was not something that crossed his mind when he took over the presidency of UK in 2001, or when he started his first company, it has been pervasive throughout his life, even when that 'sphere of influence&rsquo; was not very big. And it still exists today, now that he&rsquo;s 'retired&rsquo;.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, guys, I&rsquo;m sixty five&hellip;&rdquo; we could just see the wheels turning, as if saying &ldquo;I only have one life to live and it won&rsquo;t last forever. What am I going to do with these remaining years?&rdquo;&hellip;and then he says it for us: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying to think of ways I can make a difference.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n<p>Wow. Here&rsquo;s one of the most influential people in this state, a person that&rsquo;s lived a life that we aspire to and hope to emulate if we dedicate ours similarly. He&rsquo;s achieved a level of success and influence that we are very statistically unlikely to achieve, yet he still feels personally called to make the largest, most positive contribution he can&hellip;and maybe one even larger than that..<\/p>\n<p>You know what Dr. Todd? We&rsquo;ve only been at this for a few years and we probably have 65 more in front of us&hellip;but we were just thinking the same thing.<\/p>\n<p>People have told me that my enthusiasm for changing the world will dwindle over time, that I&rsquo;ll get realistic. I&rsquo;ve been told &ldquo;first a man wants to change the world, then he wants to change his neighborhood&hellip;eventually he just wants to change his underwear&rdquo;. This has always frustrated me. Just because many of the people sharing this advice have gone through this process in their own life or seen it in others doesn&rsquo;t mean it will happen in me, and even if it might why on earth would you want to discourage that attitude in anyone? Yes, enthusiasm must eventually bring with it wisdom in order to increase its likelihood of manifesting into something of significance. But while enthusiasm without wisdom is sometimes reckless, wisdom without action is always impotent.<\/p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know exactly the best way to go about 'starting and growing high tech, creative, and entrepreneurial companies and communities&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a pretty ambitious goal for a few twenty-somethings with no money, in a state more famous for bourbon and chicken than software and art. But we believe that these aspects of the human being, the desire to solve problems and answer questions that haven&rsquo;t been answered before, the desire to create something of beauty and significance, and the desire to grow an idea beyond yourself, are present not only at MIT but in every person given permission to pursue them and given some guidance along that journey. Though we are only on that journey ourselves, we hope to provide an example, an opportunity, and some guidance for others to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure Dr. Todd has been accused of being 'reckless&rsquo; at times. People have 'worried about his priorities&rsquo;. But he was too worried about making a difference beyond himself because he saw the potential in the people around him too&hellip;and we think he&rsquo;s pretty awesome for it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. He thinks big.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Rule #22 &ldquo;Go big or&hellip;don&rsquo;t be my friend&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As Dr. Todd talks about making a difference he speaks about what he can do for Kentucky. Yes, that&rsquo;s one person, talking about how he&rsquo;s trying to affect the lives of over 4.3 million people. While he is one of the most influential people in the state, he&rsquo;s just one guy. This is something that you can see he realizes and frustrates him at times, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop him from thinking big. And just like his mindset of making a difference has been pervasive throughout his career and life, so has he his tendency to set progressively larger goals one could easily call 'beyond reasonable&rsquo;. UK, a top 20 research institute? Turning down a buyout from Hughes Aircraft? Running a company while you are a full-time professor? Even his decision to start what became his first company was an act of big thinking, and the reason we met at Arby&rsquo;s, as he explains in his <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneurhof.com/founders/\" target=\"_blank\">Founders Series Video<\/a> (coming out 10/3/11).<\/p>\n<p>When we think big, it&rsquo;s about growing <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/teamalpha\" target=\"_blank\">Team Alpha<\/a>, or our <a href=\"http://www.awesomelabs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Labs<\/a> projects, or running a <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/team-alpha-x-launches-three-startups\" target=\"_blank\">Team Alpha X<\/a> program with some of the sharpest young entrepreneurs in the nation. We dream about <a href=\"http://buildinglayer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BuildingLayer<\/a>being acquired by Google for eight figures and automatically turning forty UK graduates into (wealthy) Google employees in the process. We think about putting an <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneurhof.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Entreprenur Hall of Fame<\/a> in each state and seeing the awareness of the importance of entrepreneurship grow throughout the United States. We don&rsquo;t think as big as Dr. Todd does now, but neither did he when he was our age. He did, however, think big enough then to eventually get where he is now, though, so we hope we&rsquo;re at least on the right track.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. He&rsquo;s not all talk.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is what gives substance to our common definition of 'Awesome stuff&rsquo;, his lifelong mindset of making a significant difference, and his desire to think and act just beyond (and sometimes far beyond) his present means. While he<\/p>\n<p>did just listen and respond during lunch, his history of results speaks for itself and that is what made his presence alone light such a fire under us. I have no doubts that Dr. Todd&rsquo;s next act will be even more 'Awesome&rsquo; than his previous ones.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;So guys, how did I do?&rdquo; I asked my friends as we stood outside, watching Dr. Todd pulling out into South Limestone St. traffic in his tan Cadillac. I had interrupted him at least a handful of times with an &ldquo;US TOO!&rdquo; kind of story or anecdote about our experiences as entrepreneurs, students, community organizers, etc. I hoped I&rsquo;d get some encouragement that I wasn&rsquo;t distastefully rude&hellip;perhaps just naively so. &ldquo;You did all right, man.&rdquo; Nick responded, with a smile &ldquo;It was a good balance of energy, since Brian and I were so dead tired&rdquo;. While this was probably the nicest way he could think of to say &ldquo;you were just a level below embarrassing&rdquo; he was actually right about balance.<\/p>\n<p>Nick had just started <a href=\"http://awesometouch.org/\" target=\"_blank\">his company<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc<\/a> has been around for two and a half years, <a href=\"http://apaxsoftware.com/\" target=\"_blank\">APAX<\/a> (Brian&rsquo;s company) has been going on for almost twice that, and Dr. Todd had a lifetime of experience&hellip;and from these different perspectives we were all working on how the conversation at that table could happen between more people and more frequently than once every three years. If Dr. Todd continues to be as awesome as he has been, I have no doubts that more people more often will be doing just that.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><strong>Part 3 – Confidence – Delivering Big<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a continuation from <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/how-richard-branson-bought-an-island-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">part 2<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Richard&rsquo;s story<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Richard Branson is attempting to purchase an island and he has chosen to start his bidding at $100,000 for one with a sticker price of $5,000,000. Needless to say, the seller (Lord Cobham) didn&rsquo;t bite at the offer right away. He actually evicted him from the island.<\/p>\n<p>A few months go by and Richard is looking everywhere for the money necessary to make this purchase&hellip;all the while slowly upping his bid so as not to completely lose the understandably upset Lord Cobham. As luck would have it, Lord Cobham was in desperate need of short term capital. He finally made Richard an offer of $180,000 and the deal was done, or rather, begun.<\/p>\n<p>According to government law at the time, alien landholders were required to build a resort on newly purchased islands or the state would take back ownership. At this point Richard was now looking at millions of dollars (it ended up being $10,000,000) and multiple years (it ended up being five) of his life to actually make his dream a reality. But he did, and to this day it has provided him and his guests with all the joy and good times he hoped it would when he purchased it back when he was just 28 years old.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lesson #3<\/strong>: &rsquo;<a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/how-richard-branson-bought-an-island-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">Asking big<\/a>&rsquo; is easy. Delivering once they say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; is the real challenge. This takes confidence.<\/p>\n<p><strong>My story: Awesome Inc - 'Asking Big&rsquo; and Ending Up Homeless<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In January of 2009, my best friend and I wanted to start a business incubator called Awesome Inc. It would be a place where people with dreams of starting a business could make them a reality, where the most creative people would be embraced to do what they love, and where brilliant technologists could solve problems and make things that would change the world. We knew much of what we were selling was just an &ldquo;image&rdquo; of start-ups, creativity, and technology, but we believed in that energy, we knew we needed a space that would reflect it.<\/p>\n<p>We found a spot in downtown Lexington, Kentucky, right on Main St. It was huge and much more expensive than we could afford. But, like Richard Branson, we put ourselves in the right place, made a phone call to the landlord and asked for a rate that was far less than he wanted, but still barely out of our price range. He said yes. I still remember jumping around on our dance floor (yes, there is a dance floor in our business incubator) celebrating the success of our 'big ask&rsquo;.<\/p>\n<p>But that was a year and a half ago. Since getting a 'yes&rsquo; from our landlord our rent has slowly climbed. I have also had to take a year off from medical school (I was a full time student when we started) and did so poorly while I was there that I am now retaking a year of classes.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve slept in our garage and showered at the local gym for almost an entire year in order to keep personal and business expenses low. My best friend and I have poured our life savings and more into making this work - and according to the accounting system (which I just checked) we have about three months to live if our tenants stop paying us. We have yet to pay ourselves one dollar.<\/p>\n<p>This endeavour could completely fold in a matter of weeks - just like the Facebook deal could have ended up not getting us a keynote speaker for our conference series, or walking away from Samsung could have not lead to my friend getting a deal with Ford, or spending only nine million dollars in five years could have resulted in Richard losing his island, his money and his time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What Do Richard&rsquo;s &amp; My Story Teach Us?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you ask big, remember that you often end up with scary situations like this.<\/p>\n<p>This last lesson is the one we talk about the least. Actually, I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone say it (and I read a lot of business blogs and magazines). Everyone will tell you not to be afraid of getting told no, putting yourself out there, etc. but I&rsquo;ve yet to hear anyone talk of the very real fear that will inevitable arise when you 'ask big&rsquo; and the person says yes.<\/p>\n<p>Flying to the Caribbean islands takes commitment.<\/p>\n<p>Telling a &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; that you, a young 28 year old, want a 98% discount takes courage.<\/p>\n<p>But actually closing the deal and agreeing to dump $10,000,000 into the project when you barely have enough money to even close on the property itself takes much confidence in yourself and your dream.<\/p>\n<p>So if you want huge entrepreneurial success, you have to 'ask big&rsquo;. Put yourself in the right place make, ask that you believe in and be ready to face the real challenge and the real fear that will inevitably come when the person on the other end says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.<\/p>"

We checked out the major manufactures and none of them made the windows except one company, and the company that did made them four inches too wide for the openings that we had and it&rsquo;s a brick house so we couldn&rsquo;t replace those measurements,&rdquo; Askren said. &ldquo;That required us to consult with custom window companies and we found out that they were $5,000 to $11,000 per window.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>As a result of those high costs, Askren put on his carpentry hat and did the project himself. Due to the results of his work he decided that he could be profitable in the construction business. He later quit his job at Lexmark, a job he had held for eighteen and a half years.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think it was the results. The results were outstanding,&rdquo; Askren said of his inspiration to start a business. &ldquo;I was surprised myself about how they turned out and anybody that has been to my house has said that I should go into business making these windows because nobody has seen windows like that here. That&rsquo;s what caused us to ask that question seriously.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>After weighing his options he found out that the answer to his question was, temporarily, &ldquo;no.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>That kind of business was too capital and labor intensive; their pockets weren&rsquo;t deep enough for the equipment and the facilities, as well as the labor, Askren said.<\/p>\n<p>Still itching to start a business, Askren, a husband and father of twins, ultimately decided that his business was going to have to be non-capital intensive and something that he could work on while still having a family life.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I had the entrepreneurial bug. The windows made me appreciate that the types of businesses that I could start were rather limited so I had to really take a lot time and consider what I wanted to get involved with. So we looked at several different options, ultimately settling on the one that we chose because it fit best with the constraints of my family and financial life,&rdquo; Askren said.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"480\" data-orig-width=\"320\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14dd79a0c1c57b470b749135b9fc500b/tumblr_inline_nf1mrhZbI81spm8pc.jpg\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14dd79a0c1c57b470b749135b9fc500b/tumblr_inline_pk0zrjftmt1spm8pc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"480\" data-orig-width=\"320\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14dd79a0c1c57b470b749135b9fc500b/tumblr_inline_nf1mrhZbI81spm8pc.jpg\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n\n<p>The product that Askren created is BuildCalc, a mobile application construction calculator that has the ability to give users layouts for all things construction. Layouts include stairs, arcs and arcs framing, rafters of all types, polygons, and rake walls.<\/p>\n<p>Among other things, it also has functions to make accurate estimates for brick, block, tile, footers, drywall, sheathing, shingles, pickets, post, panels, studs, and more.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most advanced construction calculator,&rdquo; Askren said. &ldquo;Specifically what that means is it&rsquo;s a construction calculator to help you with layouts of complicated construction things as well as material estimates. If you want to do stairs, roofs, how much drywall is needed, tile, it can help you with that.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>If a user gets lost and would like to track their previous operations, BuildCalc has the ability to track the last 200 steps made. For on the spot help, BuildCalc can provide assistance for every measurement. If more in-depth help is needed, the application directs users to its website, <a href=\"http://buildcalc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">buildcalc.com<\/a>. The instruction manual can be found under the &ldquo;<a href=\"http://buildcalc.com/manual/Manual.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">more<\/a>&rdquo; tab.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://images.macworld.com/appguide/images/333/369/423/ss2.jpg\" width=\"300\"/><\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s unique in the convenience,&rdquo; Askren said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to find this much power on your cell phone or your tablet, period. If you&rsquo;re on the job site and if you need an answer to a question about how you lay something out or how much material you need, it&rsquo;s the best option by far. Nothing comes close.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>According to Askren, competitors&rsquo; limited functions are another reason why BuildCalc is the best construction calculator on the market. His app provides twice as much information as other apps on hip roof layouts and creates multiple drawings of stair layouts. Most importantly, everything can be emailed and printed via air print, unlike other apps which cannot transfer layouts from the phone which they were created on.<\/p>\n<p>BuildCalc is available on <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/buildcalc-advanced-construction/id333369423?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D6\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes<\/a> and the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buildcalc.buildcalc\" target=\"_blank\">Android<\/a> market for $19.99.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><img alt=\"investor_question\" height=\"335\" src=\"http://awesomeinc.org/images/investor_question.jpg\" width=\"225\"/><\/p>\n<p>When I was running bookexchange.com as an undergrad I talked to lots of potential investors or business folks in general that just wanted to give advice and/or see if what we were doing was a good deal to invest in or not. We got a TON of questions and pieces of advice. Some of it was random (never will forget the French guy that was convinced we were the next Google&hellip;that will go down in history) but eventually we saw plenty of patterns and after awhile there were few suggestions, questions, and pieces of advice and feedback.<\/p>\n<p>THE question that I didn&rsquo;t hear but was waiting for an investor not just to ask about, but to grill us on was&hellip;&ldquo;How hard are you working on this?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Now, I realize this is a somewhat vague question to ask, but as a future investor (hopefully) I will hit this question from every possible angle before leaving it alone. And I&rsquo;ll probably come back to it a couple more times after that – just to make sure the stories are consistent.<\/p>\n<p>People were curious if <a href=\"http://www.bookexchange.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bookexchange.com<\/a> was a good idea or not. What our margins were, who our competition was, what the environment was like at our schools, etc. These are all important questions yes, but if we&rsquo;re not willing to work our asses off to make sure this thing not only succeeds but that we <strong>dominate<\/strong>the market then someone else will come along and beat us if it&rsquo;s actually a great idea.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to make sure to ask this especially when I have college students or any other entrepreneurs whom I suspect have other obligations outside of their business (i.e. asking questions like &lsquo;what are you doing to afford to live?&rsquo;). Was bookexchange.com a good idea? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;our team never gave it 100% for any length of time. One of our competitors – <a href=\"http://www.chegg.com/\" target=\"_blank\">chegg.com<\/a> – had an estimated valuation of around $1billion&hellip;last year. These guys (Osman and Aayush) started pretty much the same time we did. I doubt they were smarter than us. I know they weren&rsquo;t older than us. What they DEFINITELY was more committed than we were.<\/p>\n<p>Make no mistake, luck and circumstance and a proper business model in the right place at the right time are all important – but I will never let anentrepreneur out of my office that I might be investing money into without grilling the heck out of him about his commitment to the company.<\/p>\n<p>You can be lazy and/or do your business as a side hobby, but I want to know the time commitment you&rsquo;re making to the project and the significance it has in your life up front if I&rsquo;m going to invest in it and you should too if you&rsquo;re expecting it to go anywhere in a reasonable amount of time. This will be one of the biggest deciding factors in whether or not I&rsquo;ll end up investing&hellip;because it would have been one of the biggest deciding factors in the financial success or failure of bookexchange.com,regardless of whether we were successful in raising funding.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><img alt=\"heart\" src=\"http://www.freevector.com/site_media/preview_images/FreeVector-Beating-Heart-Graphics.jpg\" width=\"250\"/><\/p>\n<p>When you start out in business, it might be a long time, as in several years, until you make any dime of revenue, let alone a significant enough profit to support yourself. However, you need to know the &lsquo;heart&rsquo; of your business well enough to recognise when it&rsquo;s beating. Otherwise, you can easily get discouraged and conclude that the work you&rsquo;re doing isn&rsquo;t 'working&rsquo; and that it never will.<\/p>\n<p>At Awesome Inc there are times when I&rsquo;ll be working in our space and notice that the 'heart&rsquo; is beating. I&rsquo;ll look up and see almost all the desks are filled with entrepreneurs working on their companies. There&rsquo;s a dance lesson going on up front, a meetup of comic book artists in the conference room, and <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/teamalpha\" target=\"_blank\">Team Alpha<\/a> plugging away in the break room. There will be a photo shoot going on in the film studio and a couple engineers working in the garage on a touch screen. It&rsquo;s happening. The heart is beating.<\/p>\n<p>Now, keep in mind that none of this is really making us enough money to do anything with other than hopefully cover the rent. So why do I know that the heart of my business is beating? Better yet, how can you know that the heart of your business is beating? Here are two simple questions that are tough to answer, but once you have answered them, they will make it so obvious when it&rsquo;s happening it will be as if the walls were pulsing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do you exist?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>My company exists &ldquo;to start and grow high tech, creative, and entrepreneurial companies and communities&hellip;in fun, cool ways&rdquo;. This is the first thing you see on our website and is the first thing I say when someone asks me what my company does. So when I look around and see that touch screens are being made (high tech company), cartoon artists are collaborating (creative community), a dance class is going on (creative company), and Team Alpha is planning a Hack Fusion event (high tech community) we are fulfilling our purpose.<\/p>\n<p>Again, notice that there&rsquo;s nothing in here about making money. Rarely is someone&rsquo;s desire to make money the core reason their company exists, especially if the business is actually successful. Most people I know that start a business just to make money don&rsquo;t succeed, so if that is why you think you exist, I would encourage you to look at why you started your business again. It&rsquo;s okay to want to be financially successful, but you have to have a reason more important than another zero in your bank balance. In my case, the main motivation I have for making money is so that I can fulfill the Awesome Inc mission above in even more impactful ways (i.e. creating a fund for startups, opening up another incubator in another city, etc).<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing about the answer to this question is that you really feel like it matters. I don&rsquo;t care about real estate. I don&rsquo;t care about soft drinks or restaurants. Therefore, I don&rsquo;t own or work for companies that do these things. While I know that these industries serve a purpose in our society, I just don&rsquo;t think they matter as much as the types of things I&rsquo;m doing. Actually, I feel like what I&rsquo;m doing is some of the most important work there is. If you want to know that the business of your heart is beating you have to not only know the answer to this question, you have to really care about it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What values I stand for?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After deciding why you exist, the second most important question to determine if you&rsquo;re 'on track&rsquo; is to decide how you are going to exist. By this I do not mean things like &ldquo;first we&rsquo;ll offer this product, then we&rsquo;ll add these upgrades, then we&rsquo;ll go after this target market, etc&rdquo;. These things will change all the time. What I mean is the moral or strategic compass that will guide you no matter what decision you are making about the business.<\/p>\n<p>Tony Hseigh, CEO of Zappos.com (acquired by Amazon for $1billion) is fanatical about his company&rsquo;s core values. Things like 'be humble&rsquo;, and 'create fun, and a little weirdness&rsquo; help each person involved in the company know how to handle things like customer service calls (i.e. don&rsquo;t act like you&rsquo;re smarter than the customer, and if you have a great knock knock joke you think they&rsquo;d like, go ahead and share it). They can tell if something is going to diminish or enhance the 'heartbeat&rsquo;.<\/p>\n<p>Kleiner Perkins is one of the most successful venture capital firms in the world. Of their top ten best performing companies ever, eight of them ended up making money with a business model that was different than the one they took investment for. That&rsquo;s like asking for $100 investment to start a lemonade stand and then going out and making millions as a hot dog stand company. So even with the most successful companies, what you actually do is not nearly as predictable or important as knowing why you are doing what you are doing and the principles you will stick to no matter where your journey takes you.<\/p>\n<p>If you know those answers, you&rsquo;ll know that you&rsquo;re on the right track. Better than that, you&rsquo;ll be able to tell when the heart beats, even for a moment. Once you get a glimpse of it, you know you&rsquo;ve brought a dream to life, and that is the thrill of creating something you believe in.<\/p>"

Now, we didn&rsquo;t expect them to all move in or for the space to be &lsquo;full&rsquo; right away, but also didn&rsquo;t think that the space would consist of just one guy for the most part, good old Mike Sullivan.  Mike Sullivan runs <a href=\"http://www.abetteroffice.com/\" target=\"_blank\">abetteroffice.com <\/a>and for a long time he was the only consistent tenant in the building. For months I would come in and look around counting the people at desks and saying to myself &ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;four people here including me and Brian&hellip;is this really working? Are we making any progress?&rdquo; Almost every time I was in the space I made sure to take a headcount and see how many people were there and then have a mini-conversation in my head about whether we were making progress or not.<\/p>\n<p>A few months ago I looked around one day and acutely realized that I hadn&rsquo;t counted the number of people in the space for a long time. I don&rsquo;t remember how many people were in the building when this happened, but probably more than four or five.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if there really is a point to this story other than perhaps that it&rsquo;s pointless to stress about day-to-day measurements of progress and extremely important to <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/focus-on-the-hot-dog\" target=\"_blank\">focus on the hot dog<\/a> and to look at longer term trends like weekly or monthly. Great examples of the counterproductivity of constantly counting are the person trying to lose weight that gets discouraged when they check the scale after every meal only to see no improvement, or the stressed out stockbrocker who checks their stocks several times a day.<\/p>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t do anything to ensure that a change or result happens right now, or even today. You can, however, guarantee that if you do certain things over time – change in the right direction is inevitable.<\/p>"

This sounds a bit esoteric, at least it did the first time I heard it, but the more I look at businesses the more I realize how true this is. It&rsquo;s true in a young small company and even in a large company. Heck, even Microsoft and Apple seem to be outward expressions of their founder&rsquo;s personalities.<\/p>\n<p>When you walk into Awesome Inc., especially a year or so ago it screams &ldquo;Brian and Luke!&rdquo;. There are just a bunch of enthusiastic young people doing things they like. There are several things going on at once that cover different areas of interest – from comics to touchscreens to ballet. This is how my brain works&hellip;and so this is the environment that we&rsquo;ve created. The space has recently become much more clean and organized - something important to Therese, our Team Alpha captain and main employee - so guess what? It&rsquo;s much organized than it would be if only my personality were being reflected.<\/p>\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s important to note that not only does a business get it&rsquo;s personality from the founders, it also inherits the founders weaknesses if they are not extremely proactive about getting people on their team to compensate for those weaknesses.<\/p>\n<p>Again, look at Microsoft &amp; Apple. Bill Gates was not particularly visually creative. I doubt he spent much if any time studying calligraphy&hellip;he was too busy coding. Steve Jobs, on the other hand (who didn&rsquo;t know how to code by the way), dropped in on calligraphy classes after dropping out of college. Bill Gate&rsquo;s dominance of the software market is indicative of his in depth understanding of it and his business acumen for it. Steve Job&rsquo;s appreciation for design and visual beauty are what have made Apple and its products the standard in industrial design in their fields. Actually those calligraphy classes he dropped in on ended up coming in handy when it was time to determine the spacing between letters on the modern home computer. It ended up being the standard on all personal computers.<\/p>\n<p>But Gates/Microsoft is still trying to catch up with Steve/Apple in &lsquo;coolness&rsquo; and aesthetic design while Apple is doing its best (and finally starting to gain significant traction) an actually owning a nontrivial size of the software market.<\/p>\n<p>So realize that your personality&hellip;including your weaknesses&hellip;will come out in your business if you don&rsquo;t have a human being there to fill in with that as a strength. There is no piece of software or system that will make up for your own behavioral flaws so either fix them before you start, pay someone to take care of these types of tasks for you, or bring on a cofounder whose strengths complement your weaknesses.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>In 2008-2010 Brian and I were trying to raise money for the Awesome Inc Experience (a Y-Combinator-esque program focusing on mobile phone technology). We felt like we had everything in place to pull the trigger except funding. However, when you go up to a high net worth individual you typically can&rsquo;t just come out and say &ldquo;Hey I&rsquo;d like for you to invest in my company. Can we set up a meeting so I can give you my sales pitch?&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t do that because you haven&rsquo;t built trust. They don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re going to respect their time, respect their wish to say no, consider what they care about before giving the pitch, etc. The very act of asking them to listen to your pitch without knowing anything about them would indicate that you won&rsquo;t respect their time in an actual sales pitch meeting because you have not respected their time and wishes by refusing to learn first what their interests are to see if they are even relevant to pitch to in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>So what do we ask for instead? &ldquo;Advice and feedback.&rdquo; It costs them nothing but time (and because they are the one offering it, this can be as much or as little of their time as they choose) and it pays them a compliment by implying that you think they have something insightful to say. It also gives you an opportunity to get to know them a bit up front before actually setting up a meeting to see if it would even be worth both party&rsquo;s time to meet. If you give an elevator pitch and the person demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of what you&rsquo;re doing, then even if they are willing to offer you money, they won&rsquo;t be able to offer real insight, which turns out to be just as valuable in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>When we were first trying to raise the round we really wanted this &lsquo;advice and feedback&rsquo; because we truly did want to know where we could sharpen our pitch. However, as we became familiar with our business&rsquo;s weaknesses and strengths and we integrated much of this into our deck, the marginal value of each person&rsquo;s advice and feedback diminished drastically. We proceeded to make little to no progress on actually closing investors and 'advice and feedback&rsquo; pretty directly translations of 'investment&rsquo;. It was and is hard not to get frustrated or discouraged about it. And often we&rsquo;d joke to each other about how much &ldquo;advice and feedback&rdquo; we were trying to raise from a particular investor, &ldquo;25,000 pieces or 50,000?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But we had to (and still must) stay patient and persistent and positive, because your next potential investor doesn&rsquo;t deserve that frustration (nobody does) and it hurts nobody but you to express it. Also, we&rsquo;ve spent enough time in the angel space to know that we&rsquo;re being plenty transparent with this whole 'advice and feedback&rsquo; thing&hellip;we are genuine about it in our requests and the investors often give it, but if the deal makes sense to them and looks like it will make money, then they won&rsquo;t hesitate to transition from feedback to asking about how they can get involved.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve only heard this concept acknowledged by one other person, and he sums it up pretty well. <a href=\"http://www.feld.com/wp/\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Feld<\/a>, in his new book &rsquo;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470929820/vglnk-c6-20\" target=\"_blank\">Venture Deals<\/a>&rsquo; says &ldquo;if you want money&hellip;by all means, please ask for advice.&rdquo;<\/p>"

By lowering the bar to a place where you&rsquo;re comfortable it helps lower the uncomfortable or intimidating feelings you have towards the task.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with starting small is that it&rsquo;s not very inspiring. I read a ton of self-help/personal development literature and have come across this concept in various forms and I would always say something like, &ldquo;What? Start small? That&rsquo;s for wimps and it takes forever! If you were tough you&rsquo;d just suck it up and jump in with both feet and go balls to the walls and figure it out!&rdquo; Then I would proceed to go another month without making progress on a single one of any of the habits I would have liked to have acquired or progress towards any of the goals I would have liked to accomplished.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not sexy or exciting to start small. Hence, <a href=\"http://epicsmall.com/\" target=\"_blank\">epic small<\/a>. Epic small is about celebrating small amounts of progress. This means getting excited when even the littlest piece of advancement is made in the right direction, especially in the beginning and especially when it&rsquo;s something that involves facing one&rsquo;s fears.<\/p>\n<p>I love the use of the word &lsquo;epic&rsquo; here as well, as it puts starting small in the place where it belongs. When you are starting small you have such a better chance of seeing your project through&hellip;.there&rsquo;s no such thing as an 'epic&rsquo; journey that someone quit in a week.<\/p>\n<p>Being 'doers&rsquo; down here at Awesome Inc. we (and by 'we&rsquo; I of course mean Nick Such) decided to contribute to the 'epic small&rsquo; community by starting something small ourselves&hellip;.The Awesome Inc Bike Shop. We don&rsquo;t charge for anything. We don&rsquo;t have anything to sell you. We don&rsquo;t have a staff or hours&hellip;but we have a couple extra bikes that we can loan to tenants and we have some of the tools necessary to fix bikes that people may bring in. There – we&rsquo;ve got something. Anybody else starting something small today?<\/p>\n<p>This post was written last summer. This 'epic small&rsquo; idea has since grown into <a href=\"http://bikeky.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bike KY<\/a> and the <a href=\"http://thebrokespoke.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Broke Spoke Community Bike Shop<\/a>. Not a bad finish for starting small.<\/p>"

What would you tell me to do for the next 5 hours? Now keep in mind you want me to get good at the sport - as in, you would pick me to be on your team if we were playing a backyard game of &lsquo;x&rsquo;.<\/p>\n<p>Now, I don&rsquo;t know what your answer would be exactly, but I doubt any of you would say, &ldquo;go read this book about the sport, or here&rsquo;s a class, etc.&rdquo; What you most likely would say would be some permutation of 'go play the sport&rsquo;. Given more than 5 hours (and perhaps even in as short of a timeframe as 5 hours) it would be a good idea to receive some actual coaching or read something or watch a short tutorial of some kind. But the majority of the actual skill you acquire will come from doing&hellip;actually all of the skill you acquire will come from actually doing. The purpose of the studying, coaching, etc. is to clarify what skill you need to physically work on.<\/p>\n<p>One of the things that people fall into when learning any new skill is that they try to do it by studying instead of doing. They will read books on it, take classes, watch videos&hellip;but the fact is they are doing this in order to try to get good at actually <strong>executing<\/strong> the skills or acquiring the results of someone that has these skills. It&rsquo;s like reading about bodybuilding in order to get big muscles. It just doesn&rsquo;t happen. Now if you want to know for the sake of knowledge – sure, study the rules of basketball, muscle hypertrophy, ballet, etc. but if you actually want to acquire the skill, then go ahead and do it. This is why Nick Such (founder of Awesome Labs, AwesomeTouch, &amp; BuildingLayer) decided to <a href=\"http://nicksuch.wordpress.com/2011/08/16/what-matters-to-you-most-and-why/\" target=\"_blank\">work on his companies instead of spend two years learning how to work on companies at Stanford&rsquo;s Graduate School of Business<\/a>. People like to <a href=\"http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/we-love-to-debate-minutiae/\" target=\"_blank\">focus on minutia<\/a>and it&rsquo;s just another example of <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/planning-a-fear-based-excuse-for-doing-nothing\" target=\"_blank\">planning being a fear-based excuse for doing nothing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There is of course some happy percentage of doing/studying that fits and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s somewhat different for every skill and every person and even changes during different periods of your development&hellip;but I would surmise that it is NEVER more than 70:30 action:study and is probably much closer to 95:5 action:study. That means that in the 9.5-10 hours I you spend working every day, no more than 30 minutes should be spent to stop and read or 'study&rsquo; about how to become a better writer. 30 minutes max. The rest is just actually doing it.<\/p>\n<p>So go and spend the next 5 hours doing something (take 15 minutes to get some advice from somebody that knows what they are doing). Who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll pick you to play on my team ;)<\/p>"

      "regular-title": "Four Pillars of Awesome",
      "regular-body": "<p>At Awesome Inc, we have lots of silly rules and traditions. These things are fun and add personality to what we do, but we want to be clear about what we really stand for. Now, we of course have the explicit goal of &lsquo;starting and growing high tech, creative, and entrepreneurial companies in communities&hellip;in fun, cool ways&rsquo; and there are plenty of ways in which we can and are accomplishing this. The point, though, is that we need to be clear about the principles with which we want to pursue this grand vision as a whole, and each specific endeavor we undertake to manifest it.<\/p>\n<p>We have seven core values, but in order to make this simple we wanted to boil that down into 'Four Pillars of Awesome&rsquo; upon which at least one of each core value sits. These are those four pillars and why we&rsquo;ve chosen each one. We will get into the Core Values that are grouped under each pillar in a later post, but since these four pillars are the easiest to remember, we&rsquo;ve started here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pillar #1 - Be Good<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You have to start here if the rest of your project, this business, or your life is going to fulfill you and ultimately be worth doing, working at, or living, respectively. You can&rsquo;t do something that you don&rsquo;t believe in, that you don&rsquo;t think matters, that goes against what you know is 'right&rsquo; and 'good&rsquo; in your heart and be able to look your soul in the mirror&hellip;much less share it with the world with pride. Don&rsquo;t waste your time working on something that you believe doesn&rsquo;t matter - not that it has to be the most important task in the world, or even the most important task in your world, but it has to be a task that&rsquo;s pushing forward something that you believe in, that you know will touch people in a way that you know is really 'good&rsquo;. Another aspect of being good is being honest - always telling the truth - and having integrity - staying true to your core values. If you&rsquo;re not honest (your FF &amp; SS are high) then people can&rsquo;t count on what you say you have done or will do, so it&rsquo;s impossible to work with you. If you don&rsquo;t have integrity&hellip;well&hellip;then this whole list is pointless because you won&rsquo;t like by these standards. Many of the most well-respected people to ever live became so because of their commitment to their principles. We feel like this is not only critical to being well-respected, but one of the most important parts of being awesome as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pillar #2 - Be Excellent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you are doing something that you believe matters in a way that is in line with your moral code, your sense of purpose, it follows that you shouldn&rsquo;t then be able to accept an end result that you know isn&rsquo;t excellent. It&rsquo;s not that this result of excellence happens on your first try, or even your second or third, but that excellence is unanimously agreed upon as the final result and anything less would be morally unacceptable to all those involve because of their belief in Pillar #1. This is both an internal, subjective commitment to mastery as well as a completely objective measure of results. In other words, excellence means 'do your best no matter what&rsquo; but this maxim also doesn&rsquo;t become an excuse for not actually creating results. In order to have a company of people who produce results, each person has to be committed to improving and mastering themselves. In order to have a group of people who are committed to improving and mastering themselves, you need to have a culture that expects stellar results.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pillar #3 - Be A Friend<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Any great undertaking isn&rsquo;t done alone, and even if it could be, we aren&rsquo;t interested in doing it that way. We exist to serve others. We work next to others in pursuit of this vision. Human beings crave connection. Companies are communities. To deny any of these things is to deny reality and the happiness that comes from enjoying the company those around us. We want to connect with others that care about what we care about. We want to deeply understand the problems and desires and lives of those we hope to serve. We can&rsquo;t do this with 'coworkers&rsquo; or as a 'company&rsquo;&hellip;we can only do it as a community of friends and teammates, committing to do good with excellence for customers we care about.<\/p>\n<p>While some less than perfect teams have produced occasional excellence, no dysfunctional team ever became a dynasty. More importantly, no team has enjoyed pursuing something, no matter how good the cause and how committed to excellence everyone was, if nobody liked anyone else. People crave connection, and we figure that the easiest way to make a friend, is to be one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pillar #4 - Be You<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This one is last for a reason. If you aren&rsquo;t a person that&rsquo;s naturally committed to being good, excellent, and a friend&hellip;then we don&rsquo;t want you to be you&hellip;actually we don&rsquo;t want you, period. Awesome Inc isn&rsquo;t about you because, as the first pillar clearly states, it&rsquo;s about 'being good&rsquo; by doing good, putting integrity and honesty up front and making sure that the focus is on the product or service and the benefits it provides in the lives of our customers. But if those first three pillars deeply jive with who you are, then there&rsquo;s no reason you can&rsquo;t bring the rest of 'you&rsquo; to the table. Actually, we insist that you do just that. It&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re a part of the team - not just for your specific skill set, but because of who you are as an individual. As long as you share the foundational principles with everyone else, the type of music you like, the clothes you wear, your essence - however you define it - is an important part of what makes Awesome Inc truly Awesome.<\/p>\n<p>So remember:<\/p>\n<p>Be Good.<\/p>\n<p>Be Excellent.<\/p>\n<p>Be A Friend.<\/p>\n<p>Be You.<\/p>\n<p>&hellip;Be Awesome&hellip;<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>Your S:S ratio is what comes out of your mouth that is false : what comes out of your mouth that is true, expressed as a ratio that equals 100 (i.e. 40:60).<\/p>\n<p>Often times as an entrepreneur, especially an ambitious one, you want to move and behave with more confidence than your past experience would say you deserve to have. If you don&rsquo;t do this, if you don&rsquo;t reach beyond where you currently are – for clients or contacts or employees that are &lsquo;out of your league&rsquo; - you&rsquo;ll never grow. So you have to at least at some level act 'bigger than you really are&rsquo;.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, your word is your bond. Your reputation for honesty is really important as well. You cannot survive in business without it, and even if you could, what man with even a shred of integrity would want to?<\/p>\n<p>To err on either side of this overconfidence vs. complete honesty side is to screw up&hellip; and I want to write now about how many entrepreneurs just starting out get it wrong.<\/p>\n<p>For a myriad of reasons, perhaps lack of experience, lack of a track record of successes, baggage from haters naysayers, they aren&rsquo;t congruent. They have yet to get comfortable with the discrepancy between where they are right now exactly and where they want to be&hellip;so they try to close the gap for those around them by embellishing their past accomplishments (&hellip;also known as 'being full of&hellip;stuff&rsquo;). They aren&rsquo;t sure what those around them think and they are concerned about it&hellip;mostly because they have doubts themselves if they are good enough, brave enough, smart enough, etc. to ultimately get where they say they want to go. So, just in case you are thinking what they are thinking – in case you see the glint of fear &amp; doubt in their eye – they want to make it clear up front that they know what they are doing, or have already even done it before, when in reality neither is true.<\/p>\n<p>I know one entrepreneur that had two employees. When someone would ask him how many he had, he would say &ldquo;yeah we&rsquo;re actually a pretty small shop right now&hellip; there&rsquo;s less that 10 of us&rdquo;. Now, that&rsquo;s not lying&hellip;heck there may be a freelancer that he brings on from time to time for certain projects so on occasion there might be more than 2 employees&hellip;but &ldquo;3 or 4&rdquo; is not what people are thinking when you say &ldquo;less than 10&rdquo;. With that line of reasoning he might as well say &ldquo;less than 100&rdquo;.<\/p>\n<p>Keep your S:S low. First, unless you are willing to tell a boldfaced out in left field lie, the small amount of exaggeration you are throwing out there is not going to impress them anywhere near the amount they are going to lose respect for you when they find out the truth. In this case 'the juice isn&rsquo;t worth the squeeze&rsquo;. Second, what you are bragging about probably doesn&rsquo;t actually matter anyway. Take my buddy&rsquo;s question about number of employees&hellip;who cares if he has 2 or 10 or 50 employees? If his profit margin on each of the 50 is $1 and the 2 person shop is $25 he&rsquo;s an idiot for being that terrible of a businessman in the first scenario and a relative stud in the second.<\/p>\n<p>So keep your S:S low&hellip;and see <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/the-right-way-to-deal-with-your-ss\" target=\"_blank\">this article<\/a> on how to deal with the balance between being completely transparent and at the same time more confident than reality would indicate you&rsquo;re allowed to be.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>I&rsquo;ve already mentioned S:S in an <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/whats-your-ss-ratio\" target=\"_blank\">earlier post<\/a>, but what I didn&rsquo;t make clear was that Brian and I didn&rsquo;t come up with this metric until we had interacted with quite a few entrepreneurs. It took several interactions with lots of them to ultimately see this pattern. It was basically a &ldquo;what are character flaws that we see common to most of the people that we meet?&rdquo; kind of thing.<\/p>\n<p>We thought that S:S would be an all-inclusive metric – the end-all be-all determinant of who we would and wouldn&rsquo;t want to do business with – but then we met Z (not his real name).<\/p>\n<p>Z is a down to earth friendly guy that will literally not stop talking if you give him permission (seriously, I tried this once&hellip;spend basically a full day listening to him talk and there was no sign of him slowing down&hellip;so I gave up) and who is disgustingly talented. Seriously, he really knows what he&rsquo;s doing and he doesn&rsquo;t dress up what he has done. Put simply, his S:S is at least as low as mine, probably lower.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is, he&rsquo;s flakier than Tony the Tiger himself. He couldn&rsquo;t show up on time to a meeting if the only reason it was called was to give him a million dollars and it was being held in his living room. Now I would vouch for Z&rsquo;s talent any day of the week&hellip;but I would rarely send any business his way and any business I would send his way would come with a very frank caveat about his reliability.<\/p>\n<p>And so the &lsquo;FF&rsquo; or 'Flake Factor&rsquo; was born. The FF is the reliability of what you say you&rsquo;re going to do in the future. It is in sharp contrast to the S:S because the S:S relates to what you are currently doing and have already done and is something you on some level consciously are being misleading about. The FF, on the other hand, is simply due to a poor ability to <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/expectation-calibration\" target=\"_blank\">calibrate expectations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The FF is a more simple metric to grasp mathematically than the S:S as it is a single number between 1 and 100. The higher the number, the flakier the person. As in any quantitative system you need a standard against which you can measure other things, in this case it is the ZI or 'Z Index&rsquo;. Z&rsquo;s level of flakiness has an FF of 80. Any person flakier than Z has an FF higher and anyone lower has an FF lower than 80.<\/p>\n<p>I (and most other people for that matter) do not want to do business with people that don&rsquo;t tell me the truth (S:S issues) or with people that, although honest, can&rsquo;t deliver on time or at all (FF&hellip;we actually asked Z to make Awesome Inc&rsquo;s logo&hellip;over six months before we launched. He said he&rsquo;d get back to us in 5 days&hellip;the next time I talked to him was at a wedding where I bumped into him&hellip;9 months later).<\/p>\n<p>So, calibrate expectations and keep your FF low.<\/p>"

The ceremony lasted about two hours and honored five entrepreneurs from four different organizations, all with roots to Kentucky.<\/p>\n<p>The event had a formal feel to it, with about a half hour dedicated to H’orderves and networking in the beginning. After a short time, however, the induction ceremony got started by Director of Awesome Labs and BuildingLayer founder Nick Such, as he made a statement about how the Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame started.<\/p>\n<p>“The hall of fame began with an idea, to inspire the next great generation of entrepreneurs. The idea turned into a list … and all of a sudden this idea, just like a company, came into a reality. First and foremost it is to recognize the people who have made great contributions not only to the business world but also the commonwealth of Kentucky,” Such said.<\/p>\n<p>Members of the 2011 Hall of Fame class are Dana Bowers, iPay technologies; David Jones Sr. and Wendell Cherry, Humana; Kent Taylor, Texas Roadhouse; and Bill Samuels Jr., Makers mark.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6041/6377015401_7ac1ccca01.jpg\"><img alt=\"awards\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6d599ef179373432067e6e24e7b1880/tumblr_inline_pk3mc1HcKK1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6041/6377015401_7ac1ccca01.jpg\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p><strong>Dana Bowers<\/strong>: Dana worked in a bank for nine years. Eventually she found herself unemployed and started her first company. In her statement she said that she never wanted to become an entrepreneur and was just looking for a job. Eventually, she had a chance to start a company.<\/p>\n<p> In 2001, Bowers, along with her husband, Mike, founded iPay Technologies. During her tenure at iPay, Dana served as CEO and as a member of the board of directors. The company grew to become the largest independent electronic bill pay provider in the US. In June of 2010, iPay was sold for $300 million.<\/p>\n<p>“I’m just humbled to be on the wall with these names,” Bowers said.<\/p>\n<p><strong>David Jones Sr. (unable to attend): <\/strong>Jones got his business degree from the University of Louisville in 1954. Along with Wendell Cherry, he co-founded Extendicare as a nursing home company. In 1974 the name was changed to Humana Inc. In its March 2008 issue, Fortune Magazine named Humana one of the top 5 Most Admired Healthcare Companies in the US. By 2010, Humana was employing over 28,000 people. In 2011, Humana reached a market cap of over $14 Billion.  Additionally, they’re a Fortune 100 company with a customer base of over 11.5 million.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wendell Cherry (deceased): <\/strong>Wendell Cherry was born in Kentucky’s Hart County. He graduated from the University of Kentucky and its law school. Wendell Cherry co-founded Humana with David Jones Sr. Jones died in 1991 of lung cancer. He was 55.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kent Taylor:<\/strong> In 1990, Taylor moved from Colorado back to Louisville and founded and co-owned Buckhead Bar and Grill. In 1993, Taylor founded Texas Roadhouse. By 2010, Texas Roadhouse was doing over $1 billion in revenue and reached a market cap over $1.25 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Taylor was introduced by good friend and 2010 inductee, Papa John’s founder John Schnatter. Schnatter said that he’s applied the Texas Roadhouse culture to Papa John’s, which revolves around “fantastic people.” He also gave praise to his long time friend.<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6227/6377034965_def226e301.jpg\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4739d2cdda49eeb58dcf328be04debc2/tumblr_inline_pk3mc1Kar81spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"333\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6227/6377034965_def226e301.jpg\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>“He’s built a fantastic company. He’s well deserving of the award. I’m very lucky to have him and his family in my life,” Schnatter said of Taylor.<\/p>\n<p>In his acceptance speech, a reflective Taylor offered advice on tenacity to aspiring entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p>“To you younger folks, three of the (first) five stores we opened failed. But if you keep trying, hopefully one day it will work out for you.”<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bill Samuels Jr.: <\/strong>Makers Mark was founded in 1954 by Bill Samuels Sr. Bill Samuels Jr. is a seventh generation distiller. Samuels Jr. became president of Makers Mark in 1975, offering a smoother, less bitter taste.  In 1980, it was the first distillery in America to be recognized as a National Historic Landmark. The brand is well known because of their unique branding, many know Makers Mark as the bourbon with a red wax bottle top. In his acceptance speech, Samuels gave much of the credit to his family.<\/p>\n<p>“Mom and Dad created Makers Mark, it wasn’t me. They did all of the heavy lifting.”<\/p>\n<p>Despite his humbleness, it should be noted that Samuels turned the operation into one of the most recognizable brands in the world, helping it surpass 1 million cases bottled for the first time in 2010.<\/p>\n<p>When Samuels was thinking of his greatest accomplishment, he thought of the time that he and former UK basketball coach Tubby Smith got together and raised money for the coach’s foundation.<\/p>\n<p>“Tubby said to me it would be a good idea if I would help raise some money for his foundation. We had a couple more drinks and it got to be a pretty good idea. I mentioned it to the master distiller. He said that we have a problem because we didn’t have any extra whisky and that we would do it next year,” Samuels said. “We went on to offer 10,000 empty bottles at full retail price and people lined up to buy them.”<\/p>\n<p>Samuels Jr. retired earlier this year. His son, Rob, is now president.<\/p>\n<p>“I want to thank you all. It’s been a great 45 years. Thank you much,” Samuels said. “People who have helped us financially, we want to grow this. We’ve had a great last year and a wonderful 2011. We want to grow this organization and include more people in the process.”<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the Hall of Fame class of 2011, the ceremony also recognized five emerging entrepreneurs.

      "regular-body": "<p>Game recognize game&hellip; your parents used to say &ldquo;it takes one to know one&rdquo;, HR professionals say &ldquo;A players hire A players, B players hire C players, and C players hire losers&rdquo; all of them are permutations of the concept that &lsquo;like&rsquo; will both recognize and attract 'like&rsquo;.<\/p>\n<p>At Awesome Inc our Team Alpha Captain Therese is an all-star A player. She conducts interviews and is the person that decides who does and doesn&rsquo;t get to join the team and if they do, in what capacity. I have complete faith in her intuition and her ability to recognize quality and the types of characteristics a person who would fit in and do well around here must have.<\/p>\n<p>So go ahead and judge a book by its cover. It will save you a bunch of time and as long as you are paying attention to see which assumptions are incorrect you&rsquo;ll be able to correct as you go. Letting each person be a blank slate in every way and making no assumptions about their abilities, interests, personality, etc. would cause you to ultimately make some really stupid decisions.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Jeff is really unorganized. I think I&rsquo;ll put him in this secretary role though because I don&rsquo;t want to judge him and assume he&rsquo;s going to be bad at that.&rdquo; Jeff may end up being a rock star administrative assistant for some weird reason (i.e. he really takes organization seriously when it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s life he&rsquo;s organizing) but the fact is that he&rsquo;s probably going to stink&hellip;.so don&rsquo;t put him there.<\/p>\n<p>Again, trust your instincts and then (just as importantly) pay attention to OUTCOMES. This is pretty tough, because if Jeff has a messy desk but never drops a ball, responds quickly to emails, shows up to things on time, etc. then behind what looks chaotic is a system that apparently works. My business partner Brian&rsquo;s room looks like hell – but he knows where everything is and he doesn&rsquo;t drop balls in his personal or professional life.<\/p>\n<p>This concept is really the same as the idea of just doing something. Deciding not to judge a book by its cover is like deciding to plan despite being aware of the uselessness of that plan and of the fact that just trying something out in the real world will get you there much faster. Sending a person that you think might be good at 'X&rsquo; because you 'judged&rsquo; them in a the first 5 minutes of an interview is not a bad thing. Actually it&rsquo;s great because it gets them moving and doing something right away. Now you just have to look at what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not working and adjust it accordingly. If you meet someone that&rsquo;s dressed weird and so you assume they are creative (an assumption I make a lot) and you put them on a project that you think requires creativity and they&rsquo;re terrible then ask them what they think the problem is, why it&rsquo;s not a good fit for them (or perhaps it would be with a slightly different environment) and then make the necessary adjustments.<\/p>\n<p>Go ahead, judge a book by its cover&hellip;just make sure to open it quickly and read carefully at what it actually has to say&hellip;and trust that game will ultimately recognize game.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>Buzz words get on my nerves (and yes, I recognize the irony of that statement considering the Awesome Inc&rsquo;s three buzzword tagline - Technology, Creativity, Startups) . They so often indicate that the person using them hasn&rsquo;t actually practiced them, and more often than not they imply no real <strong>action<\/strong>. One of the buzz words I hear often not only gets on my nerves but I think whos value is overemphasized is &lsquo;collaboration&rsquo;.<\/p>\n<p>The idea behind it has the best of intentions:<\/p>\n<ul><li>If our organizations have similar goals then why don&rsquo;t we just pool our resources to make an even greater impact.<\/li>\n<li> If we get together then we can bring different ideas to the table and come up with something better than what we could have in the first place.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Now, I have no problem with people getting together to talk about ideas, etc. as long as it&rsquo;s not under the pretext that we&rsquo;re doing anything other than just talking&hellip;which is fine&hellip;there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with talking. The problem with collaboration, I think, comes in two forms:<\/p>\n<ul><li>People get together to 'collaborate&rsquo; on a project that is just a side hobby for both of them. They meet and the project ultimately goes nowhere. This is not a bad thing in some cases, as the meeting could ultimately result in making friendships, learning new skills etc. (i.e. <a href=\"http://startupweekend.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Weekend<\/a>) but the argument could very easily be made that if 'progress&rsquo; is the point – then perhaps those two people should have spent their time <a href=\"http://takeitupalevel.com/2010/09/09/forget-emdo-your-thing/\" target=\"_blank\">doing their own thing<\/a>, which they know they will be sticking with, rather than trying to 'collaborate&rsquo; on something that, because they don&rsquo;t own 100% (or for a myriad of other reasons) never comes to life.<\/li>\n<li>Collaboration slows people down or causes them to stifle their own desires and ideas because they are waiting for everyone else&rsquo;s approval and opinion. There is, of course, a difference between collaboration and consensus&hellip;but the two are not free of influence from each other. It may be politically difficult to go meet with someone saying you want to collaborate with them about something, but ultimately just take one idea of theirs and add it to what you are already doing and not actually create anything 'with&rsquo; them. Though I think this is usually the ideal outcome of 'collaborating&rsquo; with people, it isn&rsquo;t what people that come together to actually 'collaborate&rsquo; actually think of&hellip;and some get offended by it.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Ultimately, anything that keeps you from doing your thing or provides you an excuse to not take action (like<a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/planning-a-fear-based-excuse-for-doing-nothing\" target=\"_blank\">planning<\/a>) for not doing your thing (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting to hear back from so-and-so before I get started&rdquo; etc.) I am adamantly opposed to.<\/p>\n<p>The argument could also be made that the duplication of effort is inefficient in a global sense. While this may be true, the complete opposite, which is centralization and complete coordination of all efforts (also called &ldquo;communism&rdquo;) is even more inefficient&hellip;because incentives are not aligned. I&rsquo;d rather have a bunch of people running around passionately pursuing projects that are 30% similar, than all of those people being forced into doing one specific part of a project that has only 30% of their interest and effort.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>Entrepreneurial Communities, How to pitch a VC, Customer Development. These were a few of the topics that were discussed at the Techstars Network Conference in Las Vegas last weekend. This was a gold mine, for an entrepreneur in his 20&rsquo;s (since I turn 30 this week, I&rsquo;m using that phrase excessively).<\/p>\n<p>I plan to write separate posts on each of the topics above, but this post is about how <a href=\"http://www.techstars.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Techstars<\/a> is building a dynasty among startup accelerators while simultaneously lifting up accelerators nationwide.<\/p>\n<p>In early 2011 Techstars decided to launch the <a href=\"http://www.techstars.com/network/\" target=\"_blank\">Techstars Network<\/a> - a group of independently owned and operated accelerator programs from around the globe. The network currently has about 35 programs participating. Not only is this network great for all of the participating programs, it has placed Techstars at the center of the accelerator space.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"David Cohen\" src=\"http://assets.bizjournals.com/denver/news/07a.DavidCohen_1-0-117-268-376.jpg?v=1\" width=\"320\"/>David Cohen, founder of Techstars, says this about the network:<\/p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Over the next 3 years, the TechStars Network will ensure that 5,000 successful and experienced entrepreneurs and investors will mentor and support 6,000 promising young entrepreneurs, increasing their success rate tenfold and creating 25,000 new jobs by 2015 and a sustained engine for growing these figures over time.&rdquo;<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>    <br/><\/em><\/p>\n<p>I believe that the Techstars Network will accomplish all of that, as well as the following:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Increase deal flow for all programs in the network - <em>this helps all programs.<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Bring the overall quality of participating programs up significantly - <em>this helps entrepreneurs.<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Secure Techstars place as the &ldquo;Stanford&rdquo; of accelerators for startup entrepreneurs -<em> this helps Techstars.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>So, that makes it a win, win, win, right? Ok, so maybe it&rsquo;s more like win, win more, and win the most, respectively for programs, entrepreneurs, and Techstars. But, how can you argue with a program that is benefiting all parties. It&rsquo;s brilliant. And to be honest, Techstars is doing plenty of other things right to be <a href=\"http://techcocktail.com/top-15-us-startup-accelerators-ranked-2011-05\" target=\"_blank\">the number one accelerator<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As a participant of an accelerator (<a href=\"http://www.betaspring.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Betaspring<\/a>, Providence, RI) this past summer, I&rsquo;ve already witnessed some of the benefits of the network first hand. When my team started the application process, we went straight to the list of Techstars Network programs to decide where we wanted to apply. This essentially gave programs that weren&rsquo;t on this list a huge disadvantage. And, with the exception of <a href=\"http://ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Y Combinator<\/a>, we didn&rsquo;t even consider applying to any accelerators that weren&rsquo;t in the Techstars Network.<\/p>\n<p>One benefit to the network that was not in place at the time we applied was the Universal Application Process. Teams can now apply at <a href=\"http://accelerato.rs/\" target=\"_blank\">accelerato.rs<\/a>and fill out one application for all the accelerators to which they wish to apply. The application process allows for accelerators (even ones that aren&rsquo;t a part of the Techstars Network) to accept a standard set of accelerator application questions and even add custom questions if desired. The Universal Application is an initiative supported by the Kaufman Foundation, which will use aggregate data from applications for statistical purposes. Individual application information is private to the accelerator that owns the application. I would encourage all accelerators to use this application process as it saves entrepreneurs tons of time (our most valuable resource) and includes some great tools for acceptance selection.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m excited about all of the good that the Techstars Network will do for startups. I clearly remember one quote that David Cohen made at the event, &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s good for the entrepreneur, then we support it&rdquo;. I genuinely believe that about David and Techstars. I&rsquo;d like to thank them and every other initiative that is helping startup entrepreneurs across the globe.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>When a businessman is looking at all the different things that need his attention and he then creates &lsquo;priorities&rsquo;, what distinguishes something of high priority and something of low priority on a practical level? The allocation of 'resources&rsquo;. Higher priority initiatives get more 'resources&rsquo; than lower priority ones.<\/p>\n<p>But what does the word 'resources&rsquo; mean? Well, it can mean a lot of things, like equipment, office space, marketing budget, staffing, etc. but they all boil down to two things: time and money. The equipment, office space, and marketing budget are all just different forms of spent or allocated to be spent money. The staffing is simply man hours. So, if you see a crazy awesome billboard for a pizza shop and then drive there to see that both the outside and inside are decked out like DisneyLand and you order a pizza and it tastes worse than a Little Ceasars cheese pizza with no spice pack, then don&rsquo;t let that owner tell you that his priority is 'high quality&rsquo;. He can say it all he wants, but he&rsquo;s obviously put most of his time and money into the marketing and promotional aspect of his business. I&rsquo;m not saying that is right or wrong – but those ARE the priorities of the business&hellip;not what it says on a plaque on the wall or what the owner tells you when you ask him.<\/p>\n<p>The same thing goes with your life. If you want to know what matters to you most – look at your calendar and your bank statement. What are you spending your time and money, your 'resources&rsquo; on? If it&rsquo;s not what you want it to be, then put some new things on your calendar and make some new purchases/investments/donations. If it is, then good for you. If it&rsquo;s not, though, and you don&rsquo;t plan on changing anything, then consider telling people your real priorities (the ones that you spend your resources on) instead of kidding yourself and them by saying what you think they want to hear. You&rsquo;ll just end up sounding like the guy with the DisneyLand pizza shop.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>I had the privilege of hearing Steve Blank speak in person at the Techstars Network Conference in Las Vegas. If you are familiar with Steve Blank, you probably know him to be the king of Customer Development. Naturally, that was the topic on which Steve spoke.<\/p>\n<p>Steve taught me two things that day:<\/p>\n<p><strong>First, get out of the building and search for the business model.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You cannot know what your customers want without talking to them. That is why it is so important to talk to as many potential customers as possible as soon as possible. This process can be broken down into 4 steps as shown in the diagram below:<\/p>\n<div><strong id=\"internal-source-marker_0.649335773428902\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"890\" data-orig-width=\"1340\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PTwddjssQDt83HQHyD5wsz6o2OZghtnh6zdeuF9x20ykksbiGjkGvIsDGyjDFA6CFR9yQwfPylsIg8dbf5XUEjdqK_Njyzll6hgkyKc9Mcpd4Bd9uss\"><img height=\"NaN\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b78e4667ece90bf25dc5b83f26737528/tumblr_inline_pk0f7qywbn1spm8pc_540.png\" width=\"590px;\" data-orig-height=\"890\" data-orig-width=\"1340\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PTwddjssQDt83HQHyD5wsz6o2OZghtnh6zdeuF9x20ykksbiGjkGvIsDGyjDFA6CFR9yQwfPylsIg8dbf5XUEjdqK_Njyzll6hgkyKc9Mcpd4Bd9uss\"/><\/figure><\/strong><\/div>\n<div> <\/div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Step 1. Customer Discover<\/strong> - So, you think you have a solution to a problem. &ldquo;No offense, but chances are you don&rsquo;t&rdquo;&hellip;or at least chances are you don&rsquo;t have a solution that solves a problem in a way that people are willing to pay for it. You are at pre-Product-Market Fit. You should build a really simple MVP (minimum viable product) and start showing it to potential customers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2. Customer Validation<\/strong> - Once you have built a product that customers need and you&rsquo;ve been able to validate this through high user adoption (or people actually giving you their money for your product) you are at Product-Market fit. People often ask the question, &ldquo;Has my business found product-market-fit?&rdquo; I heard Alexander Osterwalder give a talk at an <a href=\"http://etl.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">ETL lecture series<\/a> at Stanford University where he answered this question with, &ldquo;If you are asking the question, then the answer is no.&rdquo; Product market fit is when your customers will kill you if you try to take it a way from them. It&rsquo;s like taking crack from an addict.<\/p>\n<p>The next step is to validate your MVP and validate your sales and marketing strategies. You need to be able to prove that you have a business model where every dollar that you put in returns greater than one dollar back.<\/p>\n<p>At this stage, a lot of times startups find out that they cannot validate their customers and need to pivot, or change, one or more components on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas\" target=\"_blank\">business model canvas<\/a>. This causes them to go back to step 1 - customer discovery. The decision to pivot should not be considered a step backwards, but rather a step closer to a business model where you can get customer validation.<\/p>\n<p>In order to manage the psychology of a pivot, Steve says to do the following:<\/p>\n<p>1. Tell your team not to freak out<\/p>\n<p>2. Pivot customers/markets first, value props later<\/p>\n<p>3. Share customer feedback with the entire team<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3. Customer Creation<\/strong> - Grow customers from few to many. There are lots of ways to do this. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Ries<\/a>talks about engines of growth in his book <a href=\"http://theleanstartup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lean Startup<\/a> - paid engine of growth, viral engine of growth, and sticky engine of growth. You can read about them <a href=\"http://www.deviantbits.com/blog/engines-of-growth.html\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 4. Company Building<\/strong> - Build your company&rsquo;s organization and management. Often the founders will find others to run the company at this stage.<\/p>\n<p>In summary, all of this starts outside of your building and in conversations with customers. So, stop selling and start listening.<\/p>\n<div><strong id=\"internal-source-marker_0.649335773428902\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"282\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cI3Rp2GjuVjZcrA5tR0c3RG-pZOzeg4EOjudj1bJpRFn5QlS6exVrPsFdm4RUZ0zLHw8Ql-UJg-JT0yzM6a45BsgSl7Ld3PTuURZ3FLl1QdJf94ijyI\"><img height=\"214px;\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4bf583d56dc017db01868689b77d580a/tumblr_inline_pk0f7rLqM71spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"379px;\" data-orig-height=\"282\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cI3Rp2GjuVjZcrA5tR0c3RG-pZOzeg4EOjudj1bJpRFn5QlS6exVrPsFdm4RUZ0zLHw8Ql-UJg-JT0yzM6a45BsgSl7Ld3PTuURZ3FLl1QdJf94ijyI\"/><\/figure><\/strong><\/div>\n<div> <\/div>\n<div>\n<p>The 2nd thing Steve taught me that day:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Startups are not smaller versions of big companies.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul><li>Large companies execute known business models. Startups are searching for repeatable and scalable business models. Startups cannot be afraid that their value props might be wrong. You probably will be wrong&hellip;a lot of times. When you&rsquo;re wrong, tweak the idea (pivot) and build another MVP.<\/li>\n<\/ul><ul><li>For a startup, writing a full blown business plan is a mistake. Sorry to all the investors in the Midwest who are reading this (which is likely zero) and have asked me for a business plan. Business plans aren&rsquo;t for startups. Neither are Financial Projections. They are a necessary evil that some investors will make you do. Writing a business plan for a startup is the equivalent to developing a full blown feature filled product as an alpha version (as opposed to an MVP). It&rsquo;s like deciding what you want your kid to be when he grows up at the age of 2 and fully investing in that. You might decide for your kid to be a pro NBA basketball player, but you don&rsquo;t know how big the kid will be, how athletic he will be, if the NBA will even be around in 20 years. Instead fill out the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas\" target=\"_blank\">business model canvas<\/a>, write one pagers, prep slide decks, but do it all quickly.\n<ul><li>Note: There is a benefit to thinking through some of the aspects of the business plan. However, I mostly just agree with Steve Blank&rsquo;s quote, &ldquo;Financial projections for startups are best taught in the English dept because they are such great creative writing&rdquo;. Treat them as such and don&rsquo;t spend a minute more on them than you absolutely must.<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Thanks Steve.

The worst offenders in this scenario are words known as &ldquo;buzzwords&rdquo;. It just so happens that three of these words, &ldquo;technology&rdquo;, &ldquo;creativity&rdquo;, and &ldquo;startups&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/AeroSuch/status/170429961113583616/photo/1/large\" target=\"_blank\">emblazon the front windows at Awesome Inc<\/a>. As a co-founder, I owe it to you to break these buzzwords down into a clearer lexicon, explaining our intent in using them, as well as how they mesh with <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/four-pillars-of-awesome\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc&rsquo;s Core Values<\/a> (Be Good, Be Excellent, Be a Friend, Be You). While my role as Director of Labs at Awesome Inc may lead you to believe that I&rsquo;m only qualified to discuss technology and startups, I assure you that is only a matter of the common misconception of these words. In fact, if I do my job well in this explanation, you will come to realize that you (the reader) are equally qualified to discuss the true meaning of creativity.<\/p>\n<p>My favorite discussion of Creativity comes from <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneurship.org/en/e360tv/entrepreneurial-thought-leader-lecture-333.aspx?video=2\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Kelley<\/a>, co-founder of design consulting firm IDEO. Tom, whose portrait hangs on our wall at Awesome Inc, is known to refer to a longitudinal <a href=\"http://educationinnovation.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/10/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">study of creativity in primary school students<\/a>. In this study, a class of students is polled each year as it progresses through school. They are asked the question, &quot;Do you consider yourself to be an artist?&rdquo; From the outset, nearly all 30 students in the class respond with a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. It seems that Kindergarteners are inherently creative, and even have the finger-painted artwork to prove it! By the time this same group of students reaches 6th grade, there are but one or two individuals who are connected with their creative spirit enough to claim to be artists. What happened?<\/p>\n<p>For me, creativity is the natural manifestation of one of our Core Values: Be You. Everyone is born with an inherent desire to be unique. Over time, societal forces (such as teenagers&rsquo; strong desire to &ldquo;fit in&rdquo;) can make us apprehensive to outwardly share our uniqueness. To conceal our unique selves, human beings often turn to consumption, seeking to create a definition of self through a series of consumption choices. We wear different clothes, listen to different music, drive a different car (or ride a <a href=\"http://thebrokespoke.org/\" target=\"_blank\">bike<\/a>!). While this is a start, I think this is a cop-out. Creativity is not produced through consumption. It comes from creating.<\/p>\n<p>Longer than mono-term buzzwords, &ldquo;adages&rdquo; are frequently overutilized and under-understood phrases. One of such is, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to give than to receive&rdquo;. When I was a kid, I used to think this solely in terms of gifts, which led me to mostly disagree with the statement. Any kid knows that it&rsquo;s awesome to receive presents! But now that I&rsquo;ve been on this planet for a quarter century, I realize that this is not just some assertion to justify redistribution of wealth. It is a path to happiness, paved by our two Core Values: Be Good, and Be a Friend. To create means to give of one&rsquo;s self to improve the lives of others. And this will bring you a deeper, more lasting type of happiness than anything that you could possibly receive.<\/p>\n<p>Artistic expressions are often recognized as the most pure form of creativity, synthesizing something tangible from what was once merely an idea. I agree with the lesson of Tom Kelley&rsquo;s story, that everyone is capable of creating art (while too few believe in their own abilities). Yet, I also believe that creativity transcends traditional artwork. Let&rsquo;s take food as an example.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, food is a necessary requirement for sustaining human life. I live under the assumption that every human life is intrinsically valuable, and thus worth sustaining. Therefore, eating is a morally good thing to do (Core Value: Be Good). Eating tasty food also brings me pleasure, but this pleasure is limited, and fleeting. It&rsquo;s brainless consumption. There must be something more satisfying.<\/p>\n<p>The next stage of enjoyment for me comes from creating a dish. The spectrum here has a wide range. It starts with simply combining or heating pre-packaged ingredients. I get measurably more satisfaction out of baking frozen pizza than from a delivery pie. Even better is creating something from a recipe. Like playing a cover song with your instrument of choice, or reproducing a famous artwork, baking from a recipe is a way to share in the original creator&rsquo;s creative experience. It involves the challenge of achieving mastery by properly performing the requisite steps. There is an awkward period when you&rsquo;re but a novice, and your reproductions are subpar. But if you persist through this struggle, you emerge on the other side with a few scarred tastebuds from a worthwhile creative battle. This is the moment when you embody another of our Core Values, Be Excellent.<\/p>\n<p>As good as excellence feels, it&rsquo;s just not fully satisfying in solitude. Eating food with others, however, lifts me up onto another plateau of satisfaction. When sharing food (CV reference: Be a Friend), that assemblage of calories becomes something more. It becomes a meal. And the event of a meal is your creation (even if someone else cooked the dish).<\/p>\n<p>The next echelon (but not the ultimate) is creating food from scratch. This involves making use of the lessons you earned through your unique voyage of imitation, and combining them into your own creation. This is where you share your personal essence and, uniquely, Be You (recognize that CV reference?).<\/p>\n<p>The final stage of creativity (and you&rsquo;ll notice that I planned our arrival here), is to combine all four Core Values (Good, Excellent, Friend, You). This final plateau is best explained in reverse order of how our CV&rsquo;s are presented. Imagine this situation: you create an excellent, unique meal to share with other people. It sounds simple, but this example of an ultimate creative act captures the whole gamut of what we stand for at Awesome Inc. In creating a unique meal of your choice, you are Being You. By executing on your plans and producing a high-quality dish, you are Being Excellent. By sharing the event of this meal with others, you are Being a Friend. Finally, by ensuring that yourself and others are nourishing your bodies, you are Being Good.<\/p>\n<p>With food as our specific example, let&rsquo;s go back to the general case of creativity. Creativity is the process of using some combination of our <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1700083/AWE_Example4_small.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">four Core Values<\/a> to produce something that didn&rsquo;t exist before. This can be<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/DP8KRVQePsCfTdNpNVaXJplU6W306LW5goYj7Tx-aoM?feat=directlink\" target=\"_blank\">artwork<\/a>, it can be <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/8kwsyp\" target=\"_blank\">food<\/a>, it can be <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcXhF0bvwJ0\" target=\"_blank\">music<\/a>, it can be <a href=\"http://nuigroup.com/forums/viewthread/8347/\" target=\"_blank\">events<\/a>, it can be <a href=\"http://buildinglayer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">software<\/a>. Creativity is Good (serves a purpose), Excellent (your goal necessitates a creative struggle), with/for a Friend (human connections yield meaning), and You (an expression of your uniqueness). But, while inherently intertwined, Consumption is not Creativity. In the same way that you cannot exhale by inhaling, you cannot create by consuming (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/lukemd\" target=\"_blank\">Rule #2 – Luke Murray<\/a>). With plenty of resources in the world to help you be a consumer, <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc<\/a> stands as a beacon to help you unleash your creativity. While creativity was once a luxury, minority activity, it no longer has to be. Through technology (we&rsquo;ll talk more about that relationship in a future blog post), anyone, including you, can create. And you should.<\/p>"

      "regular-title": "Lexington Venture Club Annual Celebration",
      "regular-body": "<p>On February 1, the Lexington Venture Club hosted its annual celebration at Buster’s Billiard and Backroom. At the event, the club celebrated 78 early stage companies that received funding and created jobs in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>The first speaker of the night was University of Kentucky President Eli Capilouto, whose presentation highlighted the growth and increasing opportunities being made available in Lexington.<\/p>\n<p>“You represent the future of Lexington and our country. The Wall Street Journal, in November, wrote about ten brain hub cities. The ones you expect were there, but Lexington was on that list of those cities that are creating mid level jobs. We bring together education and entrepreneurship,” Capilouto said in his presentation. “We create a wonderful hub and access here to make possible those dreams that you have into becoming a reality.”<\/p>\n<p>Warren Nash, Director of the Lexington and Commercialization Center at the University of Kentucky, was more than pleased to report  that the 78 profiled companies received a combined $69 million in funding, employed 780 people, 605 of which are full time, paid an average salary of $65,651 and produced revenues of over $127 million in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>“The state has supported us through all of this. Why is this important? The jobs, jobs this year increased,” Nash said.<\/p>\n<p>To be exact, the jobs created by the 78 profiled companies in 2011 equate to 279 new hires, 182 of which are full time. This is a 16.2 percent increase from 2010.<\/p>\n<p>Of the early-stage companies that were surveyed, three received footage in a video that was shown. They were Seikowave, Scout Diagnostics and SoJo Studios.<\/p>\n<p>According to its website, <a href=\"http://seikowave.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Seikowave<\/a> is developing three dimensional imaging technologies targeted at healthcare, security and industrial applications. Applications include measuring parts for automobiles, inspecting the back of semiconductor wafers, providing controller-free gaming solutions and designing dental implants.<\/p>\n<p>“The technology comes from the electrical engineering department at UK. Being in Lexington and being tied to UK gives us very good opportunities to finding the key people to support growth,” a Seikowave spokesperson said in the video.<\/p>\n<p>The second company featured in the video, <a href=\"http://www.polarpointe.com/scoutdiagnostics/Home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Scout Diagnostics<\/a>, is developing measurement tools that will allow for the early determination of Alzheimer’s disease in patients.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, <a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Garrett/Documents/301swineunit.docx\" target=\"_blank\">Sojo Studios<\/a>  defines themselves as “An Entertainment Company with Social Purpose.” Sojo provides gaming for different social media mediums while offering a portion of profits to real world project funding such as to schools in Haiti and medical projects in America. This last year, Ellen DeGeneres and Justin Bieber became sponsors and investors.<\/p>\n<p>“Our product gives users an opportunity to play and do real world good while they play. The possibilities are endless,” said Sojo Studios CFO, Mark Bunning.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the annual celebration, the Lexington Venture Club hosts five other events this year. The next event is March 21 at the Hyatt Regency. It’s networking events like these that Dean Harvey, Executive Director of the Von Allmen Center for Entrepreneurship, describes as being crucial to entrepreneurial success.<\/p>\n<p>“I think it’s the developing of a network. All of a sudden you see what’s happening. I think it’s those networking things that really change it [for a business person]. Some entrepreneurs have an idea and they’re the ones that want to take their idea forward, some people don’t have an idea and they just want to be involved. All of those companies need teams, usually it’s not just one person,” Harvey said. “All of a sudden you start forming those teams and those networks and they expand. I think it just feeds itself.”<\/p>\n<p>With Lexington now being brought up in the same conversation with some of the other heavy hitters in the start-up landscape, Harvey said that there is one thing that all of the locations have in common.<\/p>\n<p>“I think with all those, you’re going to find a university in there. Not because it’s the only thing, but the reality is, you’re going to find a Stanford sitting the middle of Silicon Valley; MIT, Harvard and others in Boston. You’re going to find a UT in Austin,” Harvey said.<\/p>\n<p>“I think part of it is the research, the student community and a lot of younger people, and they want to do things and the universities tend to support that kind of stuff. Usually, the communities around them are linked in pretty well with the university. There’s no secret, it’s just being aware, networking and encouraging it … If you look through the breadth of the companies [that were profiled at the celebration], there’s biotech stuff, there’s medical devises, there’s gaming, engineering things, manufacturing things. I think it’s very healthy to see that.”<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>As a result of an invitation to discover what makes Awesome Inc awesome, I, a known outsider, found myself stepping into 348 E. Main Street on an unassuming Thursday evening. I tentatively made my way towards the low hum of voices past an open seating area, a dance floor, a conference room, a neon green coworking space and quickly found myself among friends. I could tell immediately by the atmosphere and the conversation that I was surrounded by people that were already friends and knew one another. However, I also felt &ldquo;among friends&rdquo; in the typical sense - everyone on Team Alpha started to introduce themselves and initiate me into the conversation so that I felt as if I was &ldquo;among friends&rdquo; although I had just met them moments before. It&rsquo;s easy to feel comfortable when the inviting smells of breakfast are wafting about as if you&rsquo;re having brunch with friends on the weekend. <\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"making pancakes\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7063/6889682803_d117a93f4c.jpg\" width=\"300\"/><\/p>\n<p>While the evening started off with a social emphasis, once everyone&rsquo;s stomachs were full and the last of the pancake batter was being scraped from the bowl, it was time to get down to business. Although dubbed &ldquo;Being Awesome Pancake Dinner Club&rdquo; the true purpose of the meeting was to gather Team Alpha and share Awesome Inc&rsquo;s mission, goals and core values in a group setting. Email just isn&rsquo;t sufficient to share some messages.<\/p>\n<p>The meeting came to order and I was struck by how well the gathering exemplified what I had already deduced of the true spirit of Awesome Inc. There was an eclectic mix of Team Alpha members huddled in a circle, which included a laptop and a screen, while seated on various leather couches, stools and chairs in a cozy, loudly painted room that houses the kitchenette, multiple seating areas and a ping-pong table. The meeting location symbolized the multi-functional organization that Awesome Inc has become, while the group demonstrated the potential for anyone and everyone to be involved. The juxtaposition of the technological components in such an informal, fun environment revealed the overall culture of the organization to me, while the bright wall colors represented the passion that is in the foundation of everything they do.<\/p>\n<p>While many of my takeaways from the evening stemmed from my own observations, there were also many impactful statements spoken aloud. The mission statement, in layman&rsquo;s terms, is to create and grow creative and high tech companies. More specifically, the goal for 2012 is to start 20 companies that fall within that broad category of &ldquo;creative or high tech.&rdquo; While the definition of what&rsquo;s considered a &ldquo;company&rdquo; is still yet to be determined, there was no uncertainty when it came to the underlying strategy for achieving this objective.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"core value training\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7044/6889669253_92d8f76950.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>The overall 20 companies will consist of ten Apprentices as well as an equal number of Fellowships. The Apprentices will be companies that may not provide high long-term growth potential, but will have a high velocity to the dollar. Awesome Inc will invest a small amount to assist in their start-up and will then partake in revenue sharing. On the other hand, the Fellowships will be companies that have high potential and high growth, but will take longer to ramp up. Support for these companies will come in the form of workspace, mentors, financial contributions, and the use of Awesome Labs among other offerings. In return the companies will provide Awesome Inc with equity in their company.<\/p>\n<p>At this point in the meeting my mind is a little bit blown and I am very impressed by how the content has been presented as well as the content itself. The passion that the founders exude is almost tangible in the room and I find myself shifting towards the edge of myself and leaning forward as we circle the room and each person shares their reasons for getting involved with the organization. The remaining topic to be covered is the Core Values.<\/p>\n<p>The seven previously established values were consolidated under four main pillars: Be Good, Be Excellent, Be a Friend and Be You. You can check out the <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/four-pillars-of-awesome\" target=\"_blank\">Four Pillars of Awesome blog<\/a> posting for a thorough explanation by an insider, but here&rsquo;s my &ldquo;outsider on the inside&rdquo; overview:<\/p>\n<p>1. <strong>Be Good<\/strong>: Be honest to yourself and others and always have integrity. Good things will follow. If the product/service truly is for the good of the consumer than good things will come of it, more so than something created out of self-centered reasoning.<\/p>\n<p>2. <strong>Be Excellent<\/strong>: As you follow the guidelines within the first pillar, you should find yourself at a good place doing something you love, and once you&rsquo;re there you shouldn&rsquo;t stop until you reach excellence in your execution.<\/p>\n<p>3. <strong>Be a Friend<\/strong>: While doing what you love and doing it well is definitely awesome, there is nothing more awesome than people. Don&rsquo;t forget to collaborate and serve others in your quest for Awesomeness. The reward will be much larger than if you go it alone.<\/p>\n<p>4. <strong>Be You<\/strong>: Lastly, if you find yourself within these core values then you&rsquo;re the type of person that Awesome Inc is built on and you shouldn&rsquo;t compromise who you are in order to reach your goals.<\/p>\n<p>During the review of the core values the team was asked to participate and add their own examples and input. The leaders exemplified the values while examining them; that in itself fell within multiple pillars.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, from all of my observations, visual and otherwise, it was evident that the founders and all of the members of Team Alpha do live by these values and truly believe in the mission.<\/p>\n<p>During my personal mission to discover what makes Awesome Inc awesome, I realized it wasn&rsquo;t just those bright green walls that I loved at first sight, it is the culture that can only be created from people coming together to share their passions. The underlying mission of Awesome Inc is for each person to redefine the definition of awesome for themselves. I have no doubt that the team will come together to embody their values and live their mission statement.<\/p>"

      "regular-title": "MobileX Cincinnati Keynote Recap",
      "regular-body": "<p>MobileX Cincinnati started off with the morning keynote delivered by <a href=\"http://www.danielodio.com/about-me/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Odio<\/a>, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.getsocialize.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Socialize<\/a>, which makes apps social. Odio has also been featured on CNN, CNBC, TLC, Forbes, BBC and other media outlets. The talk covered topics on the current state of mobile, mobile entrepreneurship, big trends and opportunities, and efficiency tips.<\/p>\n<p>Odio began by discussing how there is a major problem in mobile applications in terms of making sure that users stay involved with your app.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Once somebody downloads your app, they don&rsquo;t stay engaged in your app,&rdquo; Odio said. &ldquo;You do all this work and only 35 percent of users on average even open it after downloading.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>According to Odio, even with smart phones being as big as they are, the usage rate of smart phones just passed 50 percent. However, the mobile growth rate curve literally looks like a straight, vertical line and Android is exploding. It&rsquo;s doubled its market share to 52 percent and now has a higher market share than the iPhone.<img alt=\"Daniel Odio\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7192/6998384469_334c6b7865.jpg\" width=\"300\"/><\/p>\n<p>Odio then shared what he likes to call the mobile pyramid. The mobile pyramid consists of apps on the top, mobile web in the middle and SMS/texting on the bottom. Functionality and richness of experience is on the y-axis, and distribution is on the x-axis (potential audience size).<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mobile is unsexy things like SMS, very wide distribution with very low richness of experience or sexiness factor &hellip; It can be very useful though. Moving up the pyramid we have mobile web. Mobile web still has problems with fragmentation, meaning the browsers on the phones don&rsquo;t display mobile content equally, but it&rsquo;s a lot better with fragmentation issues on native,&rdquo; Odio said. &ldquo;So you can get much wider distribution because most smart phones do have browsers and you get a much richer experience especially with HTML 5, especially with technologies like PhoneGap, where you can start accessing previously native only functionality of the phone and displaying that interactively through the browser.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Odio paused for a brief moment and then asked who in the room was familiar with PhoneGap. About half of the audience raised their hands. He then goes on to elaborate on PhoneGap and why apps like this, as well as apps in general, offer a much richer smart phone experience.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;For those of you who aren&rsquo;t familiar [with PhoneGap] you need to know that because the phone is hardware and because the browser cannot reach down into the phone to access the hardware, usually when you open up a website on a phone you&rsquo;re not able to access things like the phones camera. And because apps are compiled software, just like Microsoft Word is compiled software, and it&rsquo;s actually software that gets installed on the phone, it has much deeper access to the phones functionality and features. And that&rsquo;s why apps are on the top of the pyramid. You can do very exciting things with the app that you can&rsquo;t do with the browser.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Odio explained the paradox of choice when deciding how to launch an idea. &ldquo;There is this huge fight going on. Should you be only focused on the browser and HTML5 or should you focus on apps and on native. The problem with apps is that it&rsquo;s very narrow distribution; if you code something on Android, it&rsquo;s not going to work on the iPhone, so you have to do twice the work. There&rsquo;s a trade off here. You get very exciting features and functionality but there&rsquo;s very narrow distribution.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The next topic was big mobile trends, with software gobbling up hardware was a focal point of this segment. An example of software replacing hardware is how the keyboard has disappeared from phones and now they are digital.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"keynote\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7085/6852261510_d062c5ef1b_b.jpg\" width=\"300\"/><\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The phone is becoming much smarter. It&rsquo;s not just a phone, it&rsquo;s a hub. So for example, in the Apple store they&rsquo;re selling a radar detector, the detector is actually just the infrared sensor that sits on your dashboard, the brains of it is on your phone. You open an app, it&rsquo;s the radar detector app, you put the sensor on your dashboard and you&rsquo;ve got the radar detector. Thinking about ways to pair hardware to make the phone smarter is a very big growth area.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>API&rsquo;s are another item that Odio touched upon. He gave an example of how IBM is making a command center in Rio that gathers data from 30 agencies.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how they put it together because I&rsquo;m not on the inside of this project, but I can tell you that API&rsquo;s are what enables this type of thing to happen. When an organization makes their data available in a way that they want it to be consumed by others through an API, that lets other people be very creative with the results,&rdquo; Odio said of IBM&rsquo;s command center. &ldquo;I highly encourage you to play around with API&rsquo;s and try to do something creative with APIs.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Consumerization of business, mobile security, augmented reality and geofencing were also growth opportunities Odio discussed in his keynote.<\/p>\n<p>The final topic of Odio&rsquo;s keynote were tips on how to be efficient. He introduced his concept of forced multiplication, which is how to be only one person yet be able to get as much done in a day as possible by using problem solving technology. These included:<\/p>\n<p>CloudApp, which shows a thread between two parties. This allows users&rsquo; to take screen shots and then auto uploads it into a URL.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I use this thing 20-50 times a day. When I&rsquo;m on IM chat or sending an email or when I want to show something to somebody, it&rsquo;s a great way to share information and to share what&rsquo;s on your screen,&rdquo; Odio said of CloudApp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a massive productivity tool.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The next productivity tool he introduced to the audience was Rapportive.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It has a raplet, if you&rsquo;re using Gmail for your mail you can install it. Whenever you send somebody an email, it searches everywhere for that email address and compiles results on the right side of the screen. You can see where they work; you can connect with them on LinkedIn or on Facebook,&rdquo; Odio said.<\/p>\n<p>Boomerang is another technology Odio talked about. It allows a user to have an email returned to their inbox if the receiver hasn&rsquo;t replied, so you can remember to remind them to reply. It also allows users to send an email at a specific time in the near future, and to have your emails scheduled to return to the top of your inbox at a specific time enabling a user to not forget to reply.<\/p>\n<p>Ad Retargeting, Jigsaw and Phone Tag were the other efficiency software&rsquo;s Odio discussed.<\/p>\n<p>Watch the entire presentation <a href=\"http://www.danielodio.com/2012/03/05/who-says-cincinnati-doesnt-get-mobile/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>"

At MobileX Lexington Sean hopes to expose the difficulties and solutions of a multi-device world and bring awareness to the changing environment.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We, as a technology driven group of users and businesses, have finally gotten comfortable with understanding how to navigate a user from our email, to Facebook, to our site and backtracking systems, API and social networks are plentiful. But, all that we know was learned in the singular-device world of the past.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"Sean Shadmand\" src=\"http://mobilexconference.com/lexington2012/files/2012/02/shadmand.png\" width=\"350\"/><\/p>\n<p>In his MobileX presentation, &ldquo;The Loop&rsquo;: How You&rsquo;re Losing Customers,&rsquo; Shadmand will explain how the new viral loop in a multi-device world will work and which technological platforms and devices are best suited to tackle the right problems.<\/p>\n<p>Dubbed a &quot;strategic genius&rdquo; by the Washington Post, Shadmand is currently the president and co-founder of the Socialize, Inc., which operates as a consulting and software development company that develops mobile websites and applications for businesses worldwide. However, Shadmand is no newbie to start-up businesses and mobile entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<p>Shadmand began his career in start-ups working with one of the largest social networks in the world,<a href=\"http://www.tagged.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tagged.com<\/a>, in its early stages.

The morning kicked off with keynote <a href=\"http://www.seanshadmand.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Shadmand<\/a> (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/sshadmand\" target=\"_blank\">@sshadmand<\/a>) of<a href=\"http://www.getsocialize.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Socialize<\/a>. The topic of his presentation was &ldquo;The Loop: How You&rsquo;re Losing Customers&rdquo;.<\/p>\n<p>Shadmand entered into the entrepreneurial/ start up world when he moved to San Francisco and started working at <a href=\"http://www.tagged.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tagged<\/a>, a social network site. He then created <a href=\"http://www.familyoven.com/\" target=\"_blank\">familyoven<\/a> to share recipes. When he moved back to Washington, D.C. in 2008, mobile was taking off. Shadmand said, &ldquo;People thought mobile was a fad. A pet rock is a fad.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, Shadmand had created a DIY mobile product, <a href=\"http://www.appmakr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AppMakr<\/a>. By 2011, he had added a social component to it with Socialize. Through all of this, Shadmand became very familiar with the life cycle of apps. According to Shadmand, usership drops off to 5-10% of users 90 days after an app debuts. To fix this, Shadmand recommends to quit complaining and shape your own mobile revolution.<\/p>\n<p>To do this, Shadmand introduced the concept of The Loop. The Loop is a concept of circular mobile marketing. First the user posts something to an app and their friends see it and comment. The comments bring the original user back to the app and they post something else, which starts the circle again. The way to use The Loop to your advantage is to let your users promote your services freely to their social network.<\/p>\n<p>The key is to keep re-engaging the user. There are those who are hesitant to &ldquo;bother&rdquo; a user by allowing them to promote the app with their friends. However, users are not accidentally browsing to your app, they are choosing to download it and want to be a part of your community.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more bored that I realize,&rdquo; Shadmand says of browsing on his devices like a cell phone. His advice is to take advantage of this and give users something to distract themselves with.<\/p>"

There are several tracks attendees can choose from: entrepreneur, technical, marketing &amp; social media, and a mobile development workshop. Here are a few highlights from the morning sessions:<\/p>\n<p>Anthony Hand (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/anthonyhand\" target=\"_blank\">@anthonyhand<\/a>) presented &ldquo;Opportunities for Mobile Innovation: A Designer&rsquo;s Perspective&rdquo;. Hand is a user experience designer at Samsung Research. According to Hand, &ldquo;Facebook&rsquo;s already won. But there are a lot of niches that Facebook doesn&rsquo;t fill.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>One of these niches is filled by Instagram. The app allows users to photoshop and share photos from their phone to Facebook. Draw Something is another app that fills a niche. It debuted in February and already has over 35 million downloads. The key to success for both is the social component. To have a successful app, you must &ldquo;build social from the ground up; don&rsquo;t bolt it on at the end. [&hellip;] User experience makes or breaks an app.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Kerry Carter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/kerrycarter8\" target=\"_blank\">@kerrycarter8<\/a>) presented the &ldquo;Intersection of Sports and Technology: Mobile Trends for One Person Brands&rdquo;. Carter is a former NFL player turned mobile entrepreneur; he owns <a href=\"http://www.vivavision.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Viva Vision<\/a>, a mobile software company.<\/p>\n<p>According to Carter, the average NFL career is 3.2 years and 80% of NFL players are divorced or in financial trouble 2 years after their careers end. He was looking for a way to successfully transition out of football. Since he studied anthropology in college, Carter now considers himself a &ldquo;digital anthropologist&rdquo; the six months out of the year he&rsquo;s not playing for the Canada Football League.<\/p>\n<p>His strategy is taking his sports fan following and leveraging that in business, like Shaquille O'Neal did. However, investors are wary of athletes so he has to bring a strong business to the table. He says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the number of followers, it&rsquo;s how engaged they are.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p> Carter&rsquo;s best advice is, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to take a risk, take a risk on you.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Josh Silverman, founder of <a href=\"http://www.studyegg.com/users/sign_in\" target=\"_blank\">StudyEgg<\/a>, said during a panel session that it is important to decide if you are mobile first or web first. His company originally tried to be both, but you have to pick one and make that your focus until it works.<\/p>"

The 5 pitches were:<\/p>\n<p>•<strong>Eric Gaines<\/strong> presented Party Tutor which will provide college students with an easy to use smartphone app/website to access everything they need to allow them to have an awesome college experience as well as saving money at the same time!<\/p>\n<p>•<strong>Grant Weherley<\/strong> and his team pitched SmartLit which is a bluetooth controllable outlet which can be set to automatically turn on or off when you leave your house (by detecting that your phone is out of range).<\/p>\n<p>•<strong>Cameron Lippert<\/strong> pitched Last Call Beverages, which is a Beverage for hangover pre-treatment. This beverage, when taken during alcohol consumption, will scavenge the toxins produced from alcohol metabolism therefore reducing hangover sympton or even preventing them all together.<\/p>\n<p>•<strong>David Nelson<\/strong> pitched EHW, LLC which will create an improved walker for the elderly. Many current medical devices are &ldquo;sterile,&rdquo; lack emotionally supportive design, and convey a sense of morbid responsibility. This causes people to not use home-health products when they should. This problem is solved by designing a walker that people simply want to use. A device that has an organic feel, friendly features, and enticing curves.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"winner\" src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7192/6973081620_9916e3180c_n.jpg\" width=\"330\"/><\/p>\n<p>•<strong>Tom Dugan<\/strong> pitched Bluestone Geologic, which provides Geologic Mapping Services – Aquifers &amp; groundwater development; sinkholes &amp; build site evaluation (pre &amp; post build) using geophysical equipment &amp; techniques applied to detailed underground mapping.<\/p>\n<p>The winner decided by the judges was David Nelson who pitched EHW, LLC. The winner decided by the audience text-vote was Cameron Lippert with Last Call Beverages.<\/p>\n<p>All of the pitches were great! We&rsquo;re sure the judges had a hard time making their decision.

      "regular-body": "<p>This spring, a select group of <a href=\"http://cis.uky.edu/inet/\" target=\"_blank\">iNET<\/a> (Innovation Network for Entrepreneurial Thinking) board members from the University of Kentucky received a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant called I-CORPS.<\/p>\n<p>A team of UK students and faculty and local entrepreneurs, including Dr. Dan O'Hair, Dr. Derek Lane, Wes Brooks, Randall Stevens, and Jennifer Dupuis, participated in the I-CORPS Program – a 10-week intensive course taught by Silicon Valley entrepreneur <a href=\"http://steveblank.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Blank<\/a> and other successful entrepreneurs. The first week and last week of the program was spent in Stanford, CA learning directly from experts in the field.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;<em>The first week was like a boot camp that prepared us for the 10 weeks of hard work ahead of us. The last week was a lot more about learning how to present our ideas and the knowledge we had gained in an effective way to customers and to investors. It was a really great experience.<\/em>&rdquo; – Wes Brooks<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;<em>We started with the idea of using tailored messages – messages designed uniquely for each individual – for hurricane evacuations, because that&rsquo;s where we did our earlier research. But once we started talking to customers during that first week in Stanford, we realized right away that healthcare is where we can make a real difference, and where there is a need for this type of science<\/em>.&rdquo; - Dan O'Hair, Principal Investigator on the grant.<\/p>\n<p>Blank embraces the &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.stevenblank.com/startup_index_qty.html\" target=\"_blank\">Customer Development<\/a>&rdquo; philosophy of business creation. Throughout the ten weeks, the team was challenged to speak to 100 customers to learn whether their idea could be sold. Teams were expected to &ldquo;pivot&rdquo; their idea as customers contribute suggestions, criticisms, and the all-important answer to the question, &ldquo;would you buy this?&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Jennifer Dupuis, was added to the team after TailoredMessage pivoted to healthcare, shifting the primary goal to &lsquo;improve patient outcomes&rsquo;.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;<em>We want to help hospitals and healthcare providers connect with their patients and provide tools that help patients be healthier. I&rsquo;m excited to apply my health communications research to a technology solution that could really improve people&rsquo;s lives<\/em>.&rdquo; – Jennifer Dupuis<\/p>\n<p>The team is working to develop a website that is free to patients and allows them access to their electronic health records. Physicians will be able to check in with their patients, send customized messages, and track health data across diseases and/or demographics.<\/p>\n<p>Now that the I-CORPS program has wrapped up, Brooks states &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to turn this into a real business.&quot; <\/p>"

I hate losing more than I love winning.<\/p>\n<p>I think I know how <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)\" target=\"_blank\">Billy Beane<\/a> felt when he said that as he tried to change the game of baseball with math theory and new school &ldquo;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics\" target=\"_blank\">sabermetrics<\/a>&rdquo;.<\/p>\n<p>If you are one of the 3 people that read my personal blog, then you know that earlier this year <a href=\"http://takeitupalevel.com/2012/01/09/105/\" target=\"_blank\">I wrote about my top 6 goals for 2012<\/a>. One of them was to win state cup. Today, my soccer team lost in the semi finals of state cup 3-2. We were the better team. We controlled game, out shot our opponent 20-6. We actually played one of the best games we&rsquo;d played all season. We had beat this team in a friendly match 3-0 last season, but anyone that follows soccer knows that the better team doesn&rsquo;t always win. In soccer, more than any other sport, a team can control and dominate a game, but still walk away with a loss.<\/p>\n<p>When you lose, I think it&rsquo;s natural that the first thing for you to do is to come up with reasons &ldquo;why&rdquo; it went wrong. Even as I write this post I can&rsquo;t help but to come up with a list of things we could or should have done differently. We should have man marked the kid that scored all 3 of their goals. We should played an easier schedule leading up to state cup. If we only would have finished on our opportunities. If only we wouldn&rsquo;t have lost 2 of our key players this season.<\/p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think making this list is a bad thing, I just think you need to come up with action items and lessons learned.<\/p>\n<p>At Awesome Inc we have a board in the break room called the failure dashboard. It&rsquo;s includes a collection of all the major failures that we (and our tenant companies) experience. The purpose of the failure dashboard is to encourage people to go big and be ok with failure. We want people to be ok with failure, because it often leads to massive successes.<\/p>\n<p>I love sports because they teach you life lessons. Lessons that can be translated into school, work, and running your own business. Losing is no exception. Sports teach you lessons like - to be a winner you have to experience failure and adversity along the way. You only hear about the success stories of an athlete, but the truth is they failed a lot along the way. Winners get back up after getting knocked down.<\/p>\n<p>Just read this quote from Michael Jordan:<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I&rsquo;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I&rsquo;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I&rsquo;ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>After our loss today, I told the team two things:<\/p>\n<p>1. I&rsquo;m proud of them for working hard this season and doing everything they needed to do to prepare themselves to win a state cup.<\/p>\n<p>2. Not hitting your goals feels sucky&hellip;but remember that feeling and use it as motivation to work even harder in the future. Work so hard that you&rsquo;ll never have to experience this feeling again.<\/p>\n<p>I think that&rsquo;s what truly separates winners from losers. It&rsquo;s not decided by one match, one day on the job, one school test, or any single event. It&rsquo;s decided by what happens after you fail. Everyone ends up with something on the failure dashboard. The sign of a genuine winner though is their ability to learn from that failure and use it as motivation to win next time. A lot of the time you have to fail first in order to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>This sucky feeling I have right now probably isn&rsquo;t going to go away anytime soon. But that&rsquo;s ok. I&rsquo;ll be using it to prepare even better for next time. And whoever that opponent is next time&hellip;I&rsquo;ll save them a spot on the failure dashboard.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>As an avid fan of all things beer-related, I was ecstatic to learn about the concept of Geek&rsquo;s Night Out, a common event sponsored by IN2LEX/Commerce Lexington. This time around, the venue of the meeting of some of Lexington&rsquo;s best and brightest (the geeks!) was at the new West Sixth Brewery, a craft brewery located on Lexington&rsquo;s north side.<\/p>\n<p>Upon arriving, I was immediately welcomed by the people at the Commerce Lexington desk who informed me I would be receiving a free beer (I chose the amazing double IPA) and pretzel, making the event that much more valuable for me to attend as a poor college student. I immediately noticed the large crowd as I tried to find a seat, eventually settling for a picnic table on the patio, enjoying surprisingly pleasant weather for June in Kentucky.<\/p>\n<p>Seeing old friends and making new connections with the constant rotation of beer-guzzling entrepreneurs and tech junkies who made their rotations throughout West Sixth, Geek&rsquo;s Night Out was a great opportunity, overall, to get out of the workspace and socialize. It&rsquo;s important to take a break from the daily work grind and Geek&rsquo;s Night Out was an excellent opportunity to do so. I fully recommend that everyone come out to the next one! Awesome Inc will surely be there in full force, once again, to take advantage of the free brews and tasty food. Many thanks to IN2LEX, Commerce Lexington and the wonderful West Sixth Brewery for hosting us!<\/p>"

Since 1974, our local chamber of commerce has been organizing these trips that bring together business, government, academic, and community leaders to travel to another city. The “visit” aspect (versus just a group meeting somewhere in Lexington) serves two purposes:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Find inspiration from other cities that are doing cool things<\/li>\n<li>Bring Lexington’s leaders together in a new environment, free from the distractions of home<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>The Leadership Visits have been <a href=\"http://www.commercelexington.com/external/wcpages/wcwebcontent/webcontentpage.aspx?contentid=936\" title=\"Leadership Visit history [PDF]\" target=\"_blank\">the nexus<\/a> for some of Lexington’s great assets, including Thursday Night Live which was inspired by a visit to Greenville, SC. On this visit, one of the highlights of San Antonio was the<a href=\"http://www.thesanantonioriverwalk.com/\" title=\"It's a river. You can walk next to it.\" target=\"_blank\">River Walk<\/a>, now a major tourist attraction and downtown focal point, but once just a trickling stream. What not many people know is that there is <a href=\"http://uknow.uky.edu/content/uk-geography-maps-facts-downtown-stream\" title=\"UK Geography dept maps Town Branch Creek\" target=\"_blank\">a similar stream<\/a> that flows under Lexington. On this trip, we learned that the Town Branch Creek is perhaps more voluminous than the creek that feeds the San Antonio River. The difference is, San Antonio chose to design a beautiful, open waterway. In Lexington, we conveniently diverted our creek through a buried pipe. For a city often described as “conservative”, the notion of unearthing a buried stream and manufacturing a downtown river is nothing short of audacious. But, looking at<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Lexington,_Kentucky\" title=\"We probably had street lights, sidewalks, and sewers before you.\" target=\"_blank\">Lexington’s history<\/a>, you may be surprised to learn that we have a penchant for progressive public-private partnerships. I hope we take a gamble on this.<\/p>\n<p>With all the focus on <a href=\"http://www.placesonline.com/north_america/united_states/kentucky/lexington/introduction.asp\" title=\"Lex is the 2nd largest city in America without a significant body of water\" target=\"_blank\">the river<\/a>, another key aspect of our host city was under-emphasized: young leaders are critical in shaping the city of San Antonio. In our trip program, all participants under the age of 40 were denoted as “Emerging Leaders.”  I commented to my friends before the trip In San Antonio, “If Mark Zuckerberg, age 28, lived in Lexington, would he be considered emerged yet?” I did notice a difference in San Antonio. People in that age range are just called LEADERS. However, that designation was objectively earned. They didn’t wait for a 40th birthday party to receive permission to lead at the forefront of their city. They just went out and made it happen. The two examples with whom I’m most familiar are:<\/p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Castro\" title=\"Julian Castro on Wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Julian Castro<\/a>\n<ul><li>Mayor of San Antonio (7th largest city in the USA)<\/li>\n<li>Age 37 (Mayor since 2009, age 34)<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.rackspace.com/information/leadership/lnapier/\" title=\"Lanham Napier's profile on Rackspace\" target=\"_blank\">Lanham Napier<\/a>\n<ul><li>CEO of Rackspace (&gt;$1B annual revenue)<\/li>\n<li>Age 41 (CEO since 2006, age 35)<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>There are a few notable similarities about these two leaders. First, both are from Texas. They didn’t have to be sold on why they should live there. Both have graduate degrees from Harvard (Castro in Law, Napier in Business). This doesn’t make them inherently better leaders (heck, <a href=\"http://cl.ly/3v3V0b2H340B1q243Y1Q\" title=\"It turns out, you don't need an MBA to start a company\" target=\"_blank\">they even let me into HBS<\/a>), but it does guarantee that they know what world-class means, and demonstrate that they aren’t scared to chase after it. Also, they are in terminal positions. They can’t move any higher up within their organizations, so the only way to achieve greater things is to drag the whole organization up with you. This differs from some of Lexington’s young leaders who are not in terminal, but transient leadership positions. The best basketball player in Lexington will leave for the NBA. Even within the world of sports, San Antonio’s professional basketball team, the Spurs, provide a terminal post, and one that is <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/7982610/nba-playoffs-san-antonio-spurs-success-traces-back-david-robinson\" title=\"ESPN: The Spurs operate like an effective government\" target=\"_blank\">noted for its world-class leadership transitions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I have a friend who works with <a href=\"http://westlygroup.com/team/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Westly<\/a>, an advocate of rotating involvement in the 3 major sectors of society: business, government, and academia (I’d argue that religion fits in there as well). Looking at those three sectors, who are some of our young, already-emerged leaders within terminal organizations here in Lexington? I’ll offer a few (this list is far from exhaustive, and is based totally on my familiarity):<\/p>\n<ul><li>Business\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/brianraney\" title=\"Brian Raney on LinkedIn\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Raney<\/a> – CEO of Apax Software, co-founder of Awesome Inc<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=UUFI9KpGEeM5kTpY5vFpKRvA&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=E9Z24p2FSVY#t=335s\" title=\"Yes, Lamar can fly.\" target=\"_blank\">Lamar Wilson<\/a> and <a href=\"http://lafetaylor.com/about\" title=\"Designer and community man (he's probably on your nonprofit's board)\" target=\"_blank\">Lafe Taylor<\/a> – co-founders of 212ths and Pheeva<\/li>\n<li>Peyton Fouts – founder of <a href=\"http://www.ouibox.com/about.php\" target=\"_blank\">OuiBox<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Government\n<ul><li>Jeff Fugate and Brandi Berryman – run the <a href=\"http://lexingtondda.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lexington Downtown Development Authority<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Mayor Gray’s staff – <a href=\"http://www.lexingtonky.gov/index.aspx?page=411\" title=\"Mayor's Staff - LFUCG\" target=\"_blank\">peppered<\/a> with young folks (and his campaign staff was <a href=\"http://pageonekentucky.com/2010/08/03/jim-gray-just-announced-his-new-campaign-team/\" title=\"Under-30-yr-olds on campaign staff include Emily Gallt, Walker Mattox\" target=\"_blank\">anchored by young professionals<\/a>)<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Academia\n<ul><li>Matt Wilson – Geography professor at UK, <a href=\"http://uknow.uky.edu/content/shares-resources-lexington-fayette-urban-county-government-open-data-practices\" title=\"Lexington's Open Data initiative\" target=\"_blank\">helping push OpenLexington<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Justin Bathon – Director of <a href=\"http://schooltechleadership.org/people/directors/\" title=\"Educating the educators of the future\" target=\"_blank\">CASTLE<\/a>, world-renowned education technology policy group<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Last year, I wrote about the <a href=\"http://nicksuch.wordpress.com/2011/02/01/a-regime-change-in-kentucky-the-year-of-the-retirement/\" title=\"A Regime Change in Kentucky: the Year of the Retirement\" target=\"_blank\">departure of many of Lexington’s leaders<\/a>. With the World Equestrian Games and other recent successes, I was worried that Lexington would go downhill following their departure. Now, I look at this in a different light. Perhaps these departing leaders had one last bit of insight: the most effective action they could take was to hand off the torch to a new generation. And while earlier I perceived the under-40 designation as a form of ageism, it’s in fact a testament to the associated wisdom of Lexington’s leaders. Those who recognize this gap are doing something about it. The reason that I, and many of the other young professionals, were able to attend this trip was through the generous private donations that provided Emerging Leader scholarships. Far from excluding, Lexington’s current crop of leaders is actively including their younger peers. But, as the saying (rather apropos in equine land) goes, “You can lead a horse to water…”<\/p>\n<p>Dear leaders of my generation: the torch is now in our hands. It’s our calling to make Lexington a world-class awesome city. Let’s roll.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://awesomeinc.org/images/xcroppedrecruitinternworkshop.jpg.pagespeed.ic.uWPmoNBmBj.jpg\"/><\/p>\n<p>On June 19th, 2012, Awesome Inc partnered with Commerce Lexington to offer &ldquo;Recruiting Awesome Interns&rdquo; - a workshop geared towards those who want to learn how to recruit, select, and retain the best interns possible. I will give my own answers to some of the questions asked of the panel of Awesome Inc and Orange Leaf interns.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What the biggest benefit you get out of your internship?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The biggest benefit I get from being a part of Team Alpha at Awesome Inc is experience.<\/p>\n<p>While I watched my brother graduate college and spend 5 months looking for a job that paid more than minimum wage, eventually settling for one completely unrelated to his degree, I wondered how I could avoid a similar fate. As one who has always hated working low-wage fast food and retail jobs, I had to find a way to improve my stock as an eventual employee&hellip; So I got an internship! While I knew I would eventually have to find an internship as required by my major, I knew that the more experience I could gain before I left college, the better.<\/p>\n<p>The personal and professional value I gain from developing myself, my skills and abilities, and my relationships with the people I meet will be something irreplaceable once I leave Awesome Inc (if I ever do!) due to the genuine nature of being an intern - working voluntarily, not out of necessity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why did you pick the internship you picked?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t pick Awesome Inc, Awesome Inc picked me. While I had heard back from other internships, I didn&rsquo;t feel that they were a good fit towards my personality and, in one case, heard from someone in the position I would be filling that I would not be doing any practical work.<\/p>\n<p>The task I was given when I first interviewed for Awesome Inc, on the condition that I was interested in moving forward, was to manage their social media accounts in the busy week before the mobileX Lexington 2012 conference. Them entrusting their brand&rsquo;s name to someone they just met to me showed that they obviously had faith in my abilities, perhaps even more so than I had in my own. The trust they placed in me essentially solidified my desire to be a part of Team Alpha due to the simple fact that they made my work feel like it means something. That is enough to attract most people of above average ability – let them be an important part of something bigger than themselves. Let them be essential to you.<\/p>\n<p>Yeah, that and the free pizza.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you hear about Awesome Inc?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Awesome Inc does a great job of reaching all of the possible pipelines of recruiting quality talent. Upon deciding to go back to school, I learned that I would eventually be required to find an internship. This was good timing with my decision to seek one as the College of Journalism and Telecommunications at UK has a list of 180+ internships, paid and unpaid, in locations all over central Kentucky and the United States as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>I, fatefully, searched from the bottom up and found Awesome Inc (who was in the first 5 that I applied for) to seem like a great fit for my wide variety of abilities and interests, especially the technology element.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your role at Awesome Inc?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As stated, I was running social media accounts at first. I still keep those fed. I have, however, expanded. While I originally wanted to take a more marketing-based approach to my work at Awesome Inc, learning the magic behind advertising, pitching, etc., I was offered a few projects which coincided with other skills I had.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve got a lot of random communicative and technical skills that I picked up in my technological upbringing&hellip; and I use them. In short: I bridge many of the teams. My presence is most strongly noted on the web, blog (much of my work is behind-the-scenes) and social media teams but I have also worked with the multimedia production team in providing creative IT solutions to coincide with Awesome Inc&rsquo;s small budget.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why do you stay at Awesome Inc?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As previously expressed, I am here for the experience. I can get experience anywhere, though. Aside from the experience, the people, the culture and the work that I am given the opportunity and privilege to do are what keep me around.<\/p>\n<p>Awesome Inc is home to some of central Kentucky&rsquo;s best, brightest and most creative. On top of that, they&rsquo;re very friendly, open and accepting. While I can be a tad eccentric, even weird, I&rsquo;ve found a friend in my fellow Team Alpha members as well as the founders of Awesome Inc. Watching Brian, Luke, Therese, Nick and all of Team Alpha work inspires me to work harder and embrace Awesome Inc <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/four-pillars-of-awesome\" target=\"_blank\">Core Value #2: be excellent.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Why did you accept a non-paid internship?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Who are you kidding? Awesome Inc pays me in parking, experience, free food (including Rebecca of Premiere Dance&rsquo;s AWESOME brownies) and great friendships.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d rather do work that I love for free than do busy work that I am not passionate about for pay. Awesome Inc offered me the opportunity to do just that and that exceeded all other offers and opportunities I have had since joining. The pay is in the freedom, trust and excellence that I am given the privilege to place in my work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your goal after your internship?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ideally, I&rsquo;d like to leave Kentucky for a while. While Awesome Inc has made my time much more enjoyable, I want to see what the world has to offer. I&rsquo;ve traveled a lot and can see myself settling down to do marketing or even social media management (apparently I&rsquo;m really good at it!) in the Midwest or perhaps the Pacific Northwest. I&rsquo;m confident that much that I&rsquo;ve learned through Awesome Inc will be of use to me in the future, be it developed &ldquo;people skills&rdquo;, ping-pong domination (just kidding, I&rsquo;ve yet to beat Nick. Darn!), technical skills or just simply the greatly expanded understanding of business and economics in general.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anything else?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d really like to thank Commerce Lexington, Brian, Therese and all of the panel and audience from the workshop. You guys were great! Also, thanks to everyone at Awesome Inc for being <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/four-pillars-of-awesome\" target=\"_blank\">Core Values 1 through 4.<\/a><\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed it frequently over the past year, a lot of people suck at email.<\/p>\n<p>Before I begin this post, I must give credit where credit is due (Ainc rule #2) and acknowledge that a lot of this content comes from <a href=\"http://www.davidgcohen.com/\" target=\"_blank\">David Cohen<\/a>&rsquo;s chapter in the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Do-More-Faster-TechStars-Accelerate/dp/0470929839\" target=\"_blank\">Do More Faster<\/a> – &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Suck at E-mail&rdquo;. Please <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=iatO7HPMZQ0C&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;ots=3S7xJbU6Mu&amp;dq=people%20sucks%20at%20email%20brad%20feld&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\">read it here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like it or not, a large portion of the communication done in most jobs is via email. You owe it to yourself and those you correspond with to not suck at it. Follow these three guidelines and you&rsquo;ll be most of the way to not sucking at email.<\/p>\n<p>1. Actually read it and respond – I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ll send an email to someone and then see them a few weeks later only to have them ask me a question I&rsquo;ve already answered. I want to respond with, &ldquo;the answer is sitting in your inbox.&rdquo; So, step one is to actually read and retain the information from the email. If the message merits a response, give one. Don&rsquo;t leave the sender hanging wondering if their message got lost in the Bermuda triangle of the nets. Give that poor soul an answer. Even if it&rsquo;s one <a href=\"http://blog.awesomeinc.org/post/65090035841/please-tell-me-no\" target=\"_blank\">you think they don&rsquo;t want to hear<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>2. Reply All (when relevant) – If someone copies a colleague on an email message, it was likely on purpose. Keep that person on the thread unless there is a good reason not to. This often happens when you&rsquo;re trying to coordinate with three or more people and one person continuously hits the reply button instead of reply all resulting in only one person getting the information that was intended for the entire group. <\/p>\n<p>There are obviously exceptions to this – namely, if someone is giving you an intro to a third party, kindly move the introducer to the bcc field with a note that says, &ldquo;Thanks for the intro. Moving you to bcc.&rdquo; You can read more advice on this from our friends at <a href=\"http://www.techstars.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Techstars<\/a> in their book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Venture-Deals-Smarter-Lawyer-Capitalist/dp/0470929820\" target=\"_blank\">Venture Deals<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>3. Be concise – Most emails can be summed up in three sentences or less. Keep your emails shorter and you&rsquo;ll be more likely to get quicker responses.<\/p>\n<p>Other tips:<\/p>\n<p>1. Use it as a branding opportunity (great tip from David&rsquo;s post) – always send email from your company email address and add a signature line to the bottom. I use this as the signature line for all my emails:<\/p>\n<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"116\" data-orig-width=\"346\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd1473bbd8cbfa1f29d61fba1a0a23d3/tumblr_inline_nbcmmf8VPC1spm8pc.jpg\"><img src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd1473bbd8cbfa1f29d61fba1a0a23d3/tumblr_inline_pk0bh8qMFe1spm8pc_540.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of Brian's email signature\" data-orig-height=\"116\" data-orig-width=\"346\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd1473bbd8cbfa1f29d61fba1a0a23d3/tumblr_inline_nbcmmf8VPC1spm8pc.jpg\"/><\/figure>\n<p>2. Respond quickly (2 day max) – This is related to guideline number 1 above, but always try to respond within 2 days to emails. Even if you don&rsquo;t have the complete response ready, at least respond and say that you received the email and are working on it.<\/p>\n<p>3. Use the subject line – Emails that end up in my inbox with subject line &ldquo;(no subject)&rdquo; are a sure sign of an amateur. Don&rsquo;t make this rookie mistake. Make the subject line short and relevant.<\/p>\n<p>4. Proofread – Use spellcheck and review your emails before you send them. This is especially important if you are sending something to a potential client, investor, or partner. They will judge you by your email content.<\/p>\n<p>5. Get a good junk mail filter system – In order to help out with guideline number 1 above and have the capability to Read and Respond to all emails, you need to avoid receiving junk mail. Most email servers are pretty good at this and can be trained to move junk mail to a junk mail folder. Gmail is exceptional at this. Invest some time in ensuring you have good junk mail filter system.<\/p>"

StudentDesigned.com provides businesses and universities an opportunity to connect via an online marketplace where companies list available projects that vary according to student major, i.e. engineering, finance, marketing, business, research, etc., for universities to review and assign to their students.<\/p>\n<p>The crowd chose Bob Farinelli and his idea for an RF remote controlled farm pump irrigation system as the favorite by text message vote. Farinelli and his company Smart Farm LCC offer an alternative to the time and labor costly methods of on-site, manual intervention to turn on and off ground water pumps through real time monitoring and control algorithms. The affordable irrigation pump not only saves money and labor, but also conserves energy and ground water, reduces pump down time, and increases crop yield.<\/p>\n<p>Nick Jordan and Kyle Vaughn, participants in the startup accelerator program Awesome Inc Experience, presented an aid to college students in their search for adequate housing with the Rate My Rental. Through an online platform, Rate My Rental, allows students to easily access information concerning area housing by viewing property listings around their college campus alongside reviews of previous tenants.<\/p>\n<p>Curtis Droege of Sheltowee Tool Company pitched his idea for a fixed blade multi-tool inspired by his own camping experiences. His fixed blade multi-tool fills the gap in the current market by being comfortable enough for everyday carry but possessing patentable features that enable survival capabilities in extreme environments.<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn Hall and Mark Strickland&rsquo;s idea, Light Up For Me, solves the problem of the bottomless purse, briefcase, or backpack with their pitch for a removable light. By illuminating the bag from bottom up not top down. Light Up For Me light provides a faster, easier, and safer solution to find lost items when not much light is available.<\/p>\n<p>The night&rsquo;s excellent pitches and excellent turnout resulted in another great event for Lexington&rsquo;s startup community. Congratulations to all the teams who participated and a special thanks to all those who make 5 Across possible. Be sure not to miss 2012&rsquo;s fourth meeting of 5 Across Wednesday August, 29th where 5 local entrepreneurs will again compete for the $500 grand prize.<\/p>"

The professional and personal challenges, the high and lows, the failures and the success? Startup Weekend is a global grassroots movement of active and empowered entrepreneurs who are learning the basics of founding startups and launching successful ventures. It is the largest community of passionate entrepreneurs with over 400 past events in 100 countries around the world in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>The non-profit organization is headquartered in Seattle, Washington but Startup Weekend organizers and facilitators can be found in over 200 cities around the world. From Mongolia to South Africa to London to Brazil, people around the globe are coming together for weekend long workshops to pitch ideas, form teams, and start companies.<\/p>\n<p>All Startup Weekend events follow the same basic model: anyone is welcome to pitch their startup idea and receive feedback from their peers. Teams organically form around the top ideas (as determined by popular vote) and then it&rsquo;s a 54 hour frenzy of business model creation, coding, designing, and market validation. The weekends culminate with presentations in front of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for critical feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Whether entrepreneurs found companies, find a cofounder, meet someone new, or learn a skill far outside their usual 9-to-5, everyone is guaranteed to leave the event better prepared to navigate the chaotic but fun world of startups.<\/p>\n<p>This event is being hosted by Forge and in conjunction with the Idea Festival. We are currently looking for more sponsors, so if you are interested, please contact me.<\/p>\n<p>To register for the event: <a href=\"http://swlouisville.eventbrite.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Click Here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>For more info check out the event&rsquo;s dedicated page: <a href=\"http://louisville.startupweekend.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://louisville.startupweekend.org/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>From: <a href=\"http://www.forgehq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Forge<\/a><\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><img src=\"http://oi50.tinypic.com/15f0w3b.jpg\"/><\/p>\n<p>Lexington is quite fortunate to have a number of great local places to have a meeting or event. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a coffee shop or a bar, Lexington has something for any type of meet up. So here&rsquo;s a list of some of the awesome places to meet up in town:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://thebeertrappe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Beer Trappe<\/a><br/><em>811 E Euclid Ave<\/em><br/>The Beer Trappe opened up a few years ago as the first bar in town focused solely on craft beer. Located right in the middle of Chevy Chase, across from Lexington hang-out staple Charlie Brown&rsquo;s, the Beer Trappe is in a central location surrounded by great restaurants and other local businesses. The place itself is a laid back, yet classy joint and a wonderful place to get together with 3 or 4 others for any purpose. Just beware of those high ABV beers!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.victoriansquareshoppes.com/dining-nightlife/chase-tap-room\" target=\"_blank\">The Chase Tap Room<\/a><br/><em>401 W <\/em>Main St<br/>Located in the historic Victorian Square, right across from Rupp Arena and the Civic Center, the Chase Tap Room is an upscale bar with one of the best drink selections in town. Despite being upscale, it doesn&rsquo;t feel too stuffy and it manages to create a relaxed atmosphere. While they have an awesome beer selection (including local brews), if you&rsquo;re more interested in, say, bourbon then definitely go give The Chase Tap Room a visit.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Coffea/117376468280392\" target=\"_blank\">Coffea Island<\/a><br/><em>385 Rose St<\/em><br/>Coffea Island is the coffee house of choice near UK&rsquo;s campus. It&rsquo;s location on Rose Street makes it the closest, but they certainly aren&rsquo;t lacking in the coffee department. It&rsquo;s often crowded with students during the day, especially when finals are near, but it&rsquo;s a very relaxed environment that would be perfect for a meeting.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://coffeetimescoffeehouse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Coffee Times Coffee House<\/a><br/><em>2571 Regency Road<\/em><br/>Coffee Times is a bit further away from downtown, but people really tend to love it. The prices are fair, the atmosphere cozy and the coffee is fantastic.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.commongroundsoflexington.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Common Grounds Coffee House<\/a><br/><em>343 East High Street<\/em><br/>Common Grounds is probably Lexington&rsquo;s choice of coffee places. It&rsquo;s been around the longest and does all the things local coffee shops usually do; hosts open mic nights and poetry readings and sells local art among other things. They&rsquo;ve got great, comfortable seating so it&rsquo;s always a good place to meet up.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.countryboybrewing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Country Boy Brewing<\/a><br/><em>436 Chair Ave<\/em><br/>Country Boy is one of two local breweries to open up in the last year, and they really have outdone themselves with their creative and delicious brews. If you&rsquo;re looking for interesting beer, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with Country Boy. It should be noted that it can get pretty loud in Country Boy, so if you&rsquo;re trying to be productive it might not be the best place to go. On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re looking for a more informal place to meet up, it&rsquo;s perfect.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://eatgreatbagel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Great Bagel Company<\/a><br/><em>396 Woodland Ave<\/em><br/>Great Bagel opened up in the last year and has lived up to the name; they have really great bagels. They also serve great bagel sandwiches and great coffee so you can&rsquo;t go wrong here. They have comfortable seating and free WiFi, but they do close rather early, so if you want to meet there, make sure to do it before they close at 3PM.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lexingtonbeerworks.com/home/\" target=\"_blank\">Lexington Beerworks<\/a><br/><em>213 N Limestone<\/em><br/>Lexington Beerworks is Lexington&rsquo;s newest craft brew bar and they&rsquo;ve really put together a wonderful bar. The patio is a fantastic to hang out and the beer on tap is always great. They often have regional beers on tap and rarer beers that other places can&rsquo;t get. They even sell home-brewing equipment and host events to teach people about it. I can&rsquo;t recommend this place enough for any purpose.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mageesbakery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Magee&rsquo;s Bakery<\/a><br/><em>726 East Main Street<\/em><br/>Magee&rsquo;s is a Lexington staple and for good reason. They really have the greatest donuts and baked goods I&rsquo;ve ever had anywhere in my life. The coffee they serve is absolutely fantastic and to top it off they have some great sandwiches. It&rsquo;s a bakery though, and like Great Bagel they close early so make sure to go before they close at 4.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marikkas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Marrika&rsquo;s Bier Stube<\/a><br/><em>411 Southland Dr.<\/em><br/>Marrika&rsquo;s is Lexington&rsquo;s best German restaurant but they also have a huge bar and patio, over 700 beers to choose from, volleyball, darts, billiards and foosball. For larger groups, Marrika&rsquo;s is the perfect informal spot to meet as they have plenty of space and plenty to do.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pazzospizzapub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pazzo&rsquo;s Pizza Pub<\/a><br/><em>385 S Limestone<\/em><br/>Pazzo&rsquo;s is a UK tradition and a great spot to grab a beer and eat some pizza. They&rsquo;ve got a huge beer selection and the pizza is some of the best in town. They&rsquo;ve got big tables and plenty of space so it never seems too crowded or too loud. It&rsquo;s a good place to meet over lunch or dinner with large or small groups.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://valotta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sunrise Bakery<\/a><br/><em>111 West Main Street<\/em><br/>Sunrise is a newer bakery in town but they&rsquo;ve got some really fantastic food. The sandwiches are phenomenal and their fresh bread and pastries are just as good. It&rsquo;s a smaller place so meeting with large groups isn&rsquo;t recommended but for 2 or 3 people it&rsquo;s the perfect spot downtown.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://thirdstreetstuff.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Third Street Stuff &amp; Coffee<\/a><br/><em>257 N Limestone<\/em><br/>Third Street is another smaller local coffee shop downtown but unlike the others, it&rsquo;s a very eclectic place that you couldn&rsquo;t possibly miss. They have a lot of interesting coffee and sandwich choices but they&rsquo;re all quite delicious. The &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; part of Third Street Stuff is the shop, which sells locally made art, jewelry and various trinkets that are usually quite colorful and unique. If you&rsquo;re looking for somewhere a little different, Third Street is the place to go.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.westsixth.com/\" target=\"_blank\">West Sixth Brewing Company<\/a><br/><em>501 West 6th Street<\/em><br/>West Sixth is Lexington&rsquo;s newest brewery, and while they&rsquo;re a bit more traditional in their brewing choices than Country Boy, they make some really outstanding beers. As a place to meet up, it&rsquo;s got plenty of space and seating. Not only that, but their business is really a testament to their entrepreneurial spirit and is a remarkable success, especially considering the short period they&rsquo;ve been open.<br/><br/><\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d like to note that all of these places are local businesses and certainly are deserving of your money. Of course, if you really want Starbucks then you can always go there, too. Regardless, every Star Trek fan should remember Ferengi Rule of Acquisition number 59: &ldquo;free advice is seldom cheap.&rdquo; So get out there, start buying drinks and supporting your local businesses!<\/p>\n<p>* I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve forgotten someone, so if you know somewhere else that deserves a mention, please feel free to email me at owen@awesomeinc.org<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>For those of you who do not know who I am, I am Awesome Inc&rsquo;s D.O.G. (Director of Good). I talked with Brian, one of the founders, about pursuing this opportunity with Awesome Inc back in May after plans I made to travel out of the country had fallen through. In hindsight I am very grateful for this change in plans. After a few meetings talking about Awesome Inc and Core Value #1 I found myself so excited about helping people live with honesty, integrity, and serving others that I would wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it.<\/p>\n<p>Since I have been at Ainc one thing that has been completely clear is the founders&rsquo; security with their principles and believing wholeheartedly in their mission. They set in place <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/four-pillars-of-awesome\" target=\"_blank\">these core values<\/a>, Be Good, Be Excellent, Be a Friend, and Be You. They live each of these out on a daily basis and lead others to do the same. The Ainc culture to me is a result of these four values together.<\/p>\n<p>I would like to narrow in on Core Value # 1: Be Good.<\/p>\n<p>• Live with honesty &amp; integrity: a. Honesty – Tell the truth b. Integrity - Have moral principles and follow them c. Emulate people of character<\/p>\n<p>• Serve others: a. Be a good &amp; selfless person b. Use your life to benefit the world c. It&rsquo;s about the product; not about you<\/p>\n<p>To me Core Value #1 Be Good is all about being intentional on developing the person you are becoming. Everyone is in the process of becoming someone; not everyone however is aware or consciously directing who they are becoming. As the director of good I have formed my own personal definition of good, personal metrics, and business metrics that all align. This has challenged my way of thinking and inspired me to actively decide what kind of person I want to be. I have the privilege to encourage others to invest in the same exercise. After reflecting on what I do value I have been inspired to set metrics based on my beliefs and personal definition of good instead of letting my metrics ultimately determine what I am communicating my definition of good is. I am convinced that everyone would be much happier if they would let their metrics define their life instead of letting their life define their metrics or lack thereof.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion I am inspired to know of a place that truly reflects their values and mission. Awesome Inc, keep being good and continuing to define what that means!<\/p>\n<p>Your D. O. G.<\/p>"

      "regular-title": "Smart Social Media: The Principles of Running a Social Media Campaign",
      "regular-body": "<p>Social media campaigns are of utmost importance for &ldquo;selling&rdquo; your brand in the digital age. Running a social media campaign can be a lot of work, but if you know what to aim for, the difficulty is not too high. There are a number of key goals that any social media campaign should strive for: engagement, relevance, and understanding.<\/p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with <strong>engagement<\/strong>. Engaging your users lets you know that your social media campaign is working. Engagement occurs when people &ldquo;Like&rdquo; your status on Facebook, tweet about the post on Twitter, share your posts on Google Plus, check in to your business on Foursquare or any other myriad of interaction with your content. Even simple clicks that drive traffic to your site can provide some insight that your social media campaign will possibly lead to conversions. You can promote engagement by using hashtags, mentions, paid advertisements, among other things. You&rsquo;re more likely to get engagement through relevant content than unrelated content, as well. Your followers and fans are linked with you for a reason.<\/p>\n<p>On that note, let&rsquo;s talk about<strong> relevance<\/strong>. This is the easy part of running a social media campaign. Don&rsquo;t publish junk. Don&rsquo;t publish opinions. Don&rsquo;t publish anything that doesn&rsquo;t support your goal. A social media campaign should strive for conversions, so anything that is not relevant and draws the attention and engagement of your target audience is a waste of time. While I&rsquo;m passionate about a number of social causes, I can&rsquo;t focus on those on the Awesome Inc Twitter because our current social media campaign strives for awareness of our organization within the startup, technical, entrepreneurial communities. We aim for and get the attention of VCs, SMB owners and techies alike through our SEO optimized content and targeted engagement strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s discuss <strong>understanding<\/strong>. Your company culture is what defines the eventual outcome of your product. It&rsquo;s a huge part of your brand and, as an extension, your work. Your culture will create a vision and public perception of your company. Promoting content that fits with and exposes your company culture will do your brand more good than any sly marketing ploy. The key is to show off who you, your brand, and the people who make that brand, are.<\/p>\n<p>Your methods for covering these bases may need adjusting, but if continuously strive to engage, relate, and make your company culture understandable, you&rsquo;ll quickly figure those out on your own. Every case is different, so until you get it&hellip; Stay Awesome!<\/p>"

The first course, offered exclusively to Awesome Inc staff and interns, is a coding course in the popular programming language <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29\" target=\"_blank\">Python<\/a>. Held on the back ping-pong table in the break room, students get a foundation in both computer science application and theory, as well as the occasional history lesson. Attendance has been excellent, with more than 10 people showing up to each course.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://buildinglayer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BuildingLayer<\/a>&rsquo;s Nick Such, the organizer of this course, is learning coding skills along with the rest of the class as it progresses. He also hopes to hold future courses, which may or may not be public. Possible future course titles include: &ldquo;Your First Wordpress Website&rdquo;, &ldquo;Intro to Django&rdquo;, &ldquo;Your First Android App&rdquo; and a collaborative attempt at Stanford's <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-apps-for-ios-fall/id495054839\" target=\"_blank\">Designing Apps for iOS<\/a> course. All of these courses are taught entirely from free materials from sites like <a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn Python the Hard Way<\/a>, <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Coursera<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.udacity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Udacity<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes U<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you have an interest in learning to code and have yet to take initiative, it&rsquo;s never too late to start early! We&rsquo;re always looking for new members of <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/seeking-awesome-interns\" target=\"_blank\">Team Alpha<\/a>, Awesome Inc&rsquo;s internship program, which is allowed full, free access to the courses. So far, we&rsquo;ve all had a great time and love throwing around our new titles of &ldquo;computer programmer&rdquo; in the office! Stay Awesome!<\/p>"

Nestled in 3 floors of a historic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italianate_architecture\" target=\"_blank\">Italianate<\/a> building in the midst of the rapidly gentrifying <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_the_rhine\" target=\"_blank\">Over-The-Rhine<\/a>, The Brandery was started by a team of hard working entrepreneurs who wanted to leave their mark on the entrepreneurial scene of The Queen City.<\/p>\n<p>I made my way throughout the building, checking out the space and developing massive office envy over their well groomed coworking space. I ran into representatives from <a href=\"http://impulcity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Impulcity<\/a>, <a href=\"http://crowdhall.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CrowdHall<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.flightcar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FlightCar<\/a> and other startups that have come from all over the country for The Brandery&rsquo;s accelerator program as they sat and played poker over Moerleins and Modelos. We talked about accelerators and entrepreneurship for a short while as they pitched some of their very promising ideas to me. As one of the top 10-15 (depending on which list you consult) accelerator programs in the country, one could tell that these startups were destined for big things thanks to their quality teams and Brandery experience.<\/p>\n<p>The Brandery is a peer accelerator we respect. They have countless mentors and a strong team of &ldquo;Brandsmiths&rdquo; that push creativity and excellence from the fledgeling companies, as well as assist them in the development stages of many of the services they provide. As Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky forms one point of Kentucky-Louisville-Cincinnati&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_%28Kentucky%29\" target=\"_blank\">Golden Triangle<\/a>&rdquo; economic region, it is great for all of us to have such a strong program that attracts so much talent to our part of the country. Keep up the great work, guys!<\/p>\n<p>&hellip;and yes, I am still experiencing extreme office envy, but our ping-pong table is way nicer!<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><img src=\"http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/files/nodes/1202/opensource.jpg\" width=\"590\"/><\/p>\n<p>Starting a business can be tough, as many of us know. Once you acquire your first office space and employees, unless your company is BYOD (bring-your-own-device), you will likely end up feeling pressured to shell out thousands on expensive software licenses. Little do many know, though, that there is a treasure trove of free software that is often as good as, if not better than, the paid alternative. Most of these are available on both Windows and most Linux/Unix distributions, many being ported to Apple&rsquo;s OSX as well.<\/p>\n<p>Here are my freeware and open source picks:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Office Suite – Google Drive and OpenOffice<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google Drive is a web based alternative to the traditional office suite. It allows live, collaborative editing on documents, spreadsheets and presentations, a feature which is excellent for working on a single document or spreadsheet during a meeting with coworkers. Formatting leaves a lot to be desired, but the tool is versatile and second to none for cloud storage.<\/p>\n<p>OpenOffice, however, is more of a full-service one stop shop application suite. It has replacements for not only the traditional &ldquo;power 3&rdquo; of the Microsoft Office suite, Word, Photoshop and Excel, but also includes solutions that match Access and other niche Office applications. It doesn&rsquo;t play well with Office in terms of importing content, but exports content in the very common .doc format flawlessly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Web Browser – Mozilla Firefox<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all probably used it at one point or another. Firefox is simply the most compatible and reliable browser one will find. The large number of add-ons makes it a powerful tool for a myriad of business applications and integrates extremely well with various software tools. The memory leak issues of old have been resolved, as well, meaning that Firefox is an excellent choice for systems with less computing power than average.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Image Editor - GIMP and Gimpshop, Paint.NET<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t condone using the &ldquo;Swedish discount&rdquo;, ever, especially when programs like GIMP and Gimpshop exist. GIMP is a free, open source application used for image editing and features almost every feature of Adobe&rsquo;s Photoshop Elements including many features of the full version of Photoshop, as well. The interface takes time to get used to, but luckily, Gimpshop exists. Gimpshop is essentially GIMP with a more familiar interface, centered around one window rather than three floating ones. Both are fully functional and incredibly intuitive.<\/p>\n<p>Paint.NET is Photoshop meets MS Paint. Slightly less powerful but even more intuitive than GIMP, it&rsquo;s a great go-to for quick edits, cropping, resizing, and touch-ups.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Messaging Client – Pidgin<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some people still make heavy use of IM within business, especially Google Talk/GChat. Pidgin is an excellent desktop client on which you can communicate via your preferred instant messaging service. It&rsquo;s easy to use, intuitive, and takes up a nearly unnoticeable amount of system resources. It also allows you to use multiple IM services on one application!<\/p>\n<p><strong>E-Mail Client – Mozilla Thunderbird<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thunderbird is an incredibly intuitive and simple e-mail client. It offers most, if not all features of Microsoft&rsquo;s Outlook and combines an extremely easy to use RSS reader, to boot. It&rsquo;s a Mozilla product, so support is easy to get, as well.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Antivirus – Microsoft Security Essentials<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you have Linux or Unix on the standard desktop, you worry a lot less about security than those running Windows. With the majority of computers running Windows, though. a vast majority of viruses, malware, and other malicious codes are written for Windows. Microsoft has a free tool for all Windows users to install that scans the system much like an antivirus. It is accurate, with few false positives. It is also lightweight, using a little more than 10MB of RAM on a system scan.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PDF Utility – FoxIt Reader<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All of the functionality of Adobe Reader, but faster. Enough said.<\/p>\n<p>With plenty of awesome tools out there to save you money, <em>why<\/em> would you use anything else?<\/p>"

Team Alpha had an outing to Orangeleaf this month for one of their fundraiser nights. We took advantage of a great thing that Orangeleaf already had going. Often as individuals we miss out on opportunities to be good because we don&rsquo;t know what is going on in our community.<\/p>\n<p>Orangeleaf has started offering Monday-Wednesdays as fundraiser nights at their stores. It is a very simple process. You bring a flyer in anytime that day to help out a good cause and 25% of the sales go to the cause.<\/p>\n<p>The fundraiser we attended on August 13th at the Tiverton location was for an Elementary aged girl with cancer. All we knew about the girl is that her name is Paige and she is sick. Even though none of us know Paige or her family personally I was very glad we gave our support to them by going to Orangeleaf that night.<\/p>\n<p>Before the event Brian and I discussed writing encouraging notes to Paige and her family. Along with hanging out with great company, one of my favorite parts was writing cards to Paige. At the end of the night we were able to give the OL&rsquo;s manager a dozen or so cards for Paige and you could tell it was appreciated. All this recap of the night to say keep looking for ways to partner with the community to be good.<\/p>\n<p>Awesome Inc D.O.G,<\/p>\n<p>Amy<\/p>"

Did you also know that the video game industry is bigger than both the movie and music industries combined? Given that information, it&rsquo;s easy to see how having successful video game companies could be a huge benefit for the city of Lexington. Because of that potential, the <a href=\"http://lexingtonventureclub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lexington Venture Club<\/a> hosted a number of local game studios including Frogdice, Gun, Pheeva and Super Soul to give their take on their industry, their prospects, and challenges they have in this city.<\/p>\n<p>The companies started by talking about some of the problems they have faced and they didn&rsquo;t shy away from making some criticisms about Lexington. All of the companies echoed the fact that Lexington&rsquo;s attitude towards gaming simply isn&rsquo;t realistic or very helpful when it comes to creating an industry here. It was their impression that investors aren&rsquo;t willing to take a risk on businesses in industries they don&rsquo;t believe are legitimate, and many in Lexington do not believe video games are legitimate (but obviously, we at Awesome love games). One poignant example was that people simply don&rsquo;t encourage their children to pursue jobs in the video game industry. That attitude is reflected by the fact that Lexington has no schools teaching video game development, meaning students don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to learn more about it.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, Lexington does have a number of strengths that could make it a great hub for the industry. Compared to big cities and well-known tech hubs like San Francisco, Lexington&rsquo;s cost of living is significantly lower and that is often the biggest cost when it comes to video game development. Indie developers in particular often work for little money in hope of the payoff from the game they make. Lexington is already known as a regional hot spot for high-tech industry with great digital infrastructure, so it is only natural that video games could find a home here, too.<\/p>\n<p>The companies then gave individual presentations and here is what they had to say:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/SuperSoulStudio\" target=\"_blank\">Super Soul<\/a> started the presentation by talking about how they got their name. They work out of an old radio station that was called Super Soul which still has much of the old radio equipment and records in it (now that sounds like an awesome place to work). Super Soul currently has a game out called <a href=\"http://compromisedgame.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Compromised<\/a>, which is a futuristic shooter and has been <a href=\"http://gear-fish.com/?reviews=compromised-developer-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">very successful<\/a> on Xbox Live. They are also working on a game called Open-Source (as seen in the picture), which utilizes Xbox Kinects to create what is essentially a live Pong game with two people using audio to detect where the ball is. In fact, Super Soul demoed this game at Awesome last month and are demoing it at IndieCade in California this October. It has been highly successful for an experimental game and has garnered them quite a bit of attention in the indie video game world.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fearthegun.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gun<\/a> is taking a different approach and decided to attract some of the biggest names across the industry to get their company going. They currently have staff who worked on some of the most successful games of all time, including the Grand Theft Auto series and Call of Duty series of games. Gun is working on numerous games for multiple devices and have already gathered half a million dollars just in their initial stages of development. Just by watching their presentation and attitude, you can tell this company is going to be very successful and will be a huge name to have here in Lexington.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pheeva.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pheeva<\/a> isn&rsquo;t your average video game company. In fact, they don&rsquo;t produce video games. What they do is incentivize people to play games. Basically, Pheeva is a platform for players to use to play other games competitively and receive rewards for playing. You can use Pheeva on numerous devices from your internet browsers to your phone. I asked Lafe Taylor about how this would compare to something like <a href=\"http://www.kongregate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kongregate<\/a>. Pheeva offers prizes unlike Kongregate, but Pheeva will also offer a much bigger share of the revenue to the game developers in order to draw more and better games to their platform. The sky is the limit for Pheeva as there is little in the way of competition and they have huge flexibility with the types of games that can be on their platform.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://frogdice.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Frogdice<\/a> is probably Lexington&rsquo;s oldest gaming company. They have been releasing games since 1996 and have reached well over half a million gamers and have been doing F2P (free-to-play) games since way before F2P was cool. Frogdice recently released a casual game with surprising depth called <a href=\"http://coinncarry.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Coin &lsquo;n Carry<\/a>which has had remarkable success with the F2P model. Most games using this model expect closer to 1-5% monetization (how often players spend money in the game), but Coin 'n Carry has had a rate of 77%. Frogdice has also been extremely successful in getting women to play their games as over half their users are female.<\/p>\n<p>Check out all of these companies and make sure to support our blossoming video game industry simply by playing their games.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>Over the past year, beer has become one of Lexington&rsquo;s fastest growing industries. There has been some experimentation with beer in town before, and Alltech has managed to keep Kentucky Ale a viable and strong brand, but the new craft beer scene is something Lexington really hasn&rsquo;t seen before.<\/p>\n<p>With three breweries opened in roughly the last year, at least one new brewery on the way, numerous bars dedicated to craft beer and a home brewing store, the beer industry has shown up in force. Considering Lexington&rsquo;s demographics, it was long overdue—the average craft beer drinker is highly educated and Lexington is rated as one of the most well educated cities in the country. Not only that, but Lexington&rsquo;s art scene is booming and craft beer tends to move in to cities that place an emphasis on art.<\/p>\n<p>The beer scene now seems to be thriving, but what is it like to start a business in the beer industry, and in particular what is it like to start a business focused on beer here in Lexington? To answer those questions we talked to Mike Vincent, an owner of Lexington Beerworks, and Kore Donnelly, an owner of Blue Stallion Brewing which is set to open in a few months. Lexington Beerworks opened nearly a year ago on Limestone and is the only home brewing shop in town which also serves as a great craft beer bar. Blue Stallion is still in the process of working out their location and hopes to open their brewery with a large tasting room and to distribute their beer to local bars and restaurants.<\/p>\n<p>The beer business is, of course, still a business and there are a number of things to consider when starting one so I asked Mike and Kore some questions about why they really wanted to get into the beer business. Obviously, loving beer and brewing is a big part of it, but to start a full brewery takes a lot more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q<\/strong>: What was your inspiration and motivation for starting your business?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mike<\/strong> (Lexington Beerworks): &ldquo;Honestly, we wanted to do something interesting, and something that we loved. There&rsquo;s a natural synergy between drinking good beer and the curiosity about what goes into it, hence the craft beer bar / home brewing shop.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kore<\/strong> (Blue Stallion Brewing): &ldquo;My partners and I have wanted to open up a brewery for years, we have been making beer on a small scale for a long time and our head brewer worked for a small regional brewery in Germany. Lexington has long wanted more craft beer options and we are excited to be a part of the growing craft beer scene here.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q<\/strong>: What makes Lexington such a good place for beer?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mike<\/strong>: &ldquo;Lexington is a city full of folks that fit the craft beer enthusiast profile, and up until this point was underrepresented in terms of beer bars, brew shops and breweries. We visited Louisville a few times for inspiration and then knew that if we found the right spot in downtown Lexington we could start something as well.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kore<\/strong>: &ldquo;Several things have helped set the stage for the booming craft beer industry in Lexington. The move towards buying local is a huge part of why we have seen several breweries open but the taste for craft beer has been slowly developing in Lexington for over a decade. People are getting tired of the homogenous yellow light lager made with corn and rice adjuncts and are expanding their palate by trying interesting beers made by brewers that aren&rsquo;t interested in making the same tasteless beer we have had for the last 80 years.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone we have talked to about this, from the local government officials, the bank, and people that have just heard what we are doing, has been incredibly excited about the idea. People want this to happen; it feels like we have so many allies to get this project off the ground. We have always talked internally about making the community our partner in the venture, we want to add to the culture and attraction of Lexington – but it seems like the community wants to be our partner just as much as we want to be theirs.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>I know I certainly identify with not wanting to drink tasteless lagers. And it&rsquo;s not often that you see the kind of support from the community and local government to get businesses off the ground. On the other hand, there are certainly some challenges that come with any businesses and both Beerworks and Blue Stallion have had their share.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Q<\/strong>: What are some challenges you&rsquo;ve had, if any, so far?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mike<\/strong>: &ldquo;EVERYTHING - but that&rsquo;s what learning is all about. [You are] completely accountable and responsible for success or failure.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kore<\/strong>: &ldquo;There have been several things that have gummed up the works a little bit as we developed our plan but the biggest challenge would certainly be finding an appropriate location for the business. One thing that became clear after months of research was how capital intensive a brewery is. This is probably a lesson that every business owner has learned, regardless of industry but especially true of a manufacturing business like a brewery.<\/p>\n<p>Smaller cities than Lexington, such as Asheville, NC, have become wonderful havens for craft beer recently, and we hope Lexington can become one as well. It&rsquo;s certainly well on the way there, but it will continue to require a lot of support from the community. Craft beer is an industry that adds a lot to the reputation of a city and can bring a lot of people to Lexington as tourists. Get out there, try something new (and not a generic light lager!) and support your local breweries and beer businesses. Much our vibrant art or food scenes, a craft beer scene can make Lexington a better and more enjoyable place to live.<\/p>\n<p>Here are all of our local beer-centric places.

      "regular-body": "<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"102\" src=\"http://www.startupkentucky.com/images/stories/crowdedlogofinal.png\" width=\"313\"/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stadionaut.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Crowded<\/a> is a free mobile application that uses live interactive play prediction and trivia at baseball games to test the knowledge of fans in the stadium. Players compete for accolades and are offered prizes for top scores, which will be tied into stadium concessions and other prizes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspired you to start your company?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Baseball is fun to watch as a kid, but it loses its entertainment value as you get older. In fact, fans are so desperate for engagement that many of them come up with games to play in the stands to pass the time between plays. This lack of engagement is what inspired us to build something awesome.<\/p>\n<p>Crowded is the mobile version of a game everyone plays with their friends. The goal is to try to predict what will happen next on the field. Using a simple interface, fans can dial in their prediction and then they become focused on the field to see what will happen. If your prediction is correct, not only do you get bragging rights, but you get points. This spirit of competition is the difference between the baseball we watched as kids, and the games we&rsquo;re watching today.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What problem does your product or service solve?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Crowded solved two problems for the baseball industry.<\/p>\n<p>1) Baseball is boring. Roughly 50% of a baseball game is idle time. This accounts for inning changes, batting changes, etc. Crowded entertains fans during this downtime and builds anticipation for the plays ahead.<\/p>\n<p>2) Turning spectators into fans. Many stadiums resort to gimmicks to attract and entertain the public. Watching the kiss cam and mascots who run the bases contributes to the ballpark experience, but does very little to create fans. To be sustainable, stadiums must find a way to turn the spectators into fans. Crowded teaches the fundamentals of baseball and also allows fans to learn more about the players as well. Before long, they&rsquo;ll be rooting for their favorite player and returning to the park again and again.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the three biggest challenges you face right now as a startup?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1. Scheduling development to meet the deadlines set by the baseball season.<\/p>\n<p>2. Navigating the hierarchy of the baseball industry while quickly testing business models.<\/p>\n<p>3. Raising funds to pay for the data required to build Crowded.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you like most about having your startup located in Kentucky?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to describe the feeling of being a part of the Lexington startup community - it&rsquo;s electric. Compared to larger cities, it is still in its infancy, but this gives young entrepreneurs the opportunity to shape it into something amazing. The growth of the network is deliberate and exponential. I love going to the startup coffee clubs, pitch competitions, and Startup Weekends knowing that I&rsquo;m directly contributing to the future of Kentucky&rsquo;s startup community.<\/p>"

Daugherty, <a href=\"mailto:lcdaugherty@kstc.com\" target=\"_blank\">lcdaugherty@kstc.com<\/a> or 859-246-3225.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Governor&rsquo;s School for Entrepreneurs Launched<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A new initiative designed to enhance creative thinking and entrepreneurial skills among high school students in Kentucky was announced Wednesday, December 5th at a press conference hosted by Governor Steve Beshear. The Governor&rsquo;s School for Entrepreneurs (GSE), building on the successful Governor&rsquo;s Scholars and Governor&rsquo;s School For the Arts programs, will bring together high school students, teachers, colleges, universities, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers and product designers in an annual immersive high-energy summer experience. This summer program will be followed with additional educational experiences. The June 2013 site for the summer GSE program will be Georgetown College.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;We know that most of the net new jobs across the U.S. are being created by small, young companies,&rdquo; said Gov. Beshear. &ldquo;This new initiative is part of a larger, ambitious strategy to create a dynamic entrepreneurial economy in Kentucky. Building a successful 21st century economy must begin by preparing our young people to be familiar with creative thinking and design thinking. We need them to fully understand the process of creating an innovative product or service and developing a business model around it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Young people are shaping the ideas and innovations forming the economic future of our state and nation. By developing talent early and broadly Kentucky can remain competitive in emerging economies driven by innovation and entrepreneurial skills. GSE seeks to uncover young talent that traditional academic pathways might not draw out. Participating students will be from multiple backgrounds with diverse talents and ideas and a passion to create something.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;GSE stands out from many other youth entrepreneurship programs because it places a strong emphasis on business fundamentals, entrepreneurship and product design as well as creative thinking and the innovation process,&rdquo; said Laurie Daugherty, Director of GSE and Associate Vice President of the Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation.<\/p>\n<p>GSE will be working in partnership with a range of companies and organizations, including the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development, Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education and The Kentucky Innovation Network in the design and execution of the program. The program will be led by the Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation.<\/p>\n<p>GSE will begin accepting applications as of today, December 6, 2012 through February 15, 2013.

Yes, that is it above.  A bunch of my friends sitting around working&hellip;working on the project that has been my passion for the last four years.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m a huge believer in doing life with your business partners and co workers. I give talks to student entrepreneurs all the time about the importance of having a great team. I believe that most of the success and all of the happiness you&rsquo;ll experience in your business venture will be influenced by the people around you. This is the case for entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs alike, but entrepreneurs have an advantage because we get to pick our teammates.<\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gyGp3wMxChkKIUqMdBxuazSYzQpuhZSqQjKzg2eFftDBPn0-rLGDqGN-PdePgm4bBrzf-3nsUWl8s8WmyBXIaArAV21560m3tD_5HiKcCpGPO8Ouno8\"><img height=\"NaN\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.8889578458614102\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ec45581c233b7d9781ea8179c877dba/tumblr_inline_pk1m5aDVZl1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"345px;\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/gyGp3wMxChkKIUqMdBxuazSYzQpuhZSqQjKzg2eFftDBPn0-rLGDqGN-PdePgm4bBrzf-3nsUWl8s8WmyBXIaArAV21560m3tD_5HiKcCpGPO8Ouno8\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m very fortunate that my friends and the people I work with have a lot of overlap. My birthday party last week was a perfect example of this. This was not a typical birthday party, but it was the most appropriate gift my friends could give. We didn&rsquo;t go see a movie, go out to dinner, or hit up the clubs. Instead, we met at the offices at Awesome Inc and spent the entire night working on the 2013 version of the Awesome Inc Experience accelerator program. We created marketing materials, launched a website, designed a logo, created promo videos, and planned scheduled outings for the program.<\/p>\n<p>It was a birthday full of awesome&hellip;and full of productivity for my company, Awesome Inc.<\/p>\n<p>I fully recognize that many people will see this as weird or crazy. And that&rsquo;s ok. I never claimed to be normal. One of my friends explained it quite well, &ldquo;This party IS Brian&rsquo;s idea of fun. A lot of people would pick to go to bowling, watch a basketball game, or go to the bar with their friends for their birthday. Brian enjoys his work and would often pick working with his friends over most other options.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t enjoy watching basketball games or doing other more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; fun things with my friends. I actually enjoy those things a lot. I also enjoy being productive and expanding impact. I&rsquo;ve found this to be a common theme among entrepreneurs - they enjoy creation more than consumption.<br/> <\/p>\n<p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NjoCh-kG4xm0eLVUedBIl1FMIzF8mhE_MVGwc9TF4j3XmmaT4i01R6kv_qA0CgvZxZM_J3E9zu4QNcOwmFZjVgNZ1A9sh_QPY-UxsmiI0bwVdhAa5Ts\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"207px;\" id=\"internal-source-marker_0.8889578458614102\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a1b1933cbed0f35519bb17d1b4e9de1/tumblr_inline_pk1m5abUwZ1spm8pc_540.jpg\" width=\"276px;\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NjoCh-kG4xm0eLVUedBIl1FMIzF8mhE_MVGwc9TF4j3XmmaT4i01R6kv_qA0CgvZxZM_J3E9zu4QNcOwmFZjVgNZ1A9sh_QPY-UxsmiI0bwVdhAa5Ts\"/><\/figure><\/p>\n<p><em>CV #3: &ldquo;Be a Friend&rdquo; is being painted on the break room wall at Awesome Inc<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The combination of creation and friendship is core to the culture at Awesome Inc.

I strongly believe that this is also critical to building a startup community. People are attracted to people that know how to bring the fun and if you&rsquo;re going to build a community you need to know how to attract people.<\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m extremely lucky to have such talented and fun coworkers and friends.

      "regular-title": "How Many Angel Investments?",
      "regular-body": "<p>As regular readers know, I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the <a href=\"http://sites.kauffman.org/aipp/\" target=\"_blank\">AIPP data<\/a> set collected by <a href=\"http://www.willamette.edu/~wiltbank/\" target=\"_blank\">Rob Wiltbank<\/a>. In <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/13/angel-investors-make-2-5x-returns-overall/\" target=\"_blank\">this TechCrunch article<\/a> from a while back, Rob corrected the mistaken assertion that angels don&rsquo;t make money. He also said that, &ldquo;Angel investors probably should look to make at least a dozen investments&hellip;&rdquo; While this statement isn&rsquo;t wrong, neither is it as nuanced as I would like.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://possibleinsight.com/2010/05/11/simulating-angel-investment-kevins-remix/\" target=\"_blank\">In this previous post<\/a>, I used simulated data to examine the issue of adequate diversification. As it happens, I&rsquo;ve also privately analyzed this issue using Rob&rsquo;s AIPP data, an analysis I will now make public. [<em>Hat tip to Paul P, a colleague with a professional financial statistics background who inspired and reviewed the original analysis, though any mistakes remain mine<\/em>.]<\/p>\n<p>To achieve my fully nuanced answer, I need to address two issues. But I&rsquo;ll devote separate posts to each issue. This post addresses the issue that diversification is a tradeoff. More diversification will always protect you slightly more from idiosyncratic risk, all other things being equal (see my diversification posts <a href=\"http://possibleinsight.com/2012/05/02/diversification-is-a-fact/\" target=\"_blank\">one<\/a> and<a href=\"http://possibleinsight.com/2012/05/15/even-if-youre-good-diversification-matters/\" target=\"_blank\">two<\/a>). But diversification isn&rsquo;t free. It&rsquo;s harder to make 10 investments than 1, and harder still to make 100. As an investor, you want to know how much each additional investment reduces idiosyncratic risk so you can make the right tradeoff for you.<\/p>\n<p>To demonstrate this tradeoff, I&rsquo;ll focus on <a href=\"http://www.rightsidecapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RSCM<\/a>&rsquo;s particular investing strategy: seed stage, no follow on, technology sector. I documented how I applied this strategy to the AIPP data set, complete with filtered data file, in<a href=\"http://possibleinsight.com/2011/08/23/the-vc-homerun-myth/\" target=\"_blank\"> this post<\/a>. In principle, you could create a filtered data file for your own strategy as described in<a href=\"http://possibleinsight.com/2011/01/25/more-angel-investing-returns/\" target=\"_blank\"> this other post<\/a> and then apply the procedure below to calculate the precise diversification tradeoff for your strategy.<\/p>\n<p>The key to the whole problem a statistical technique called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_%28statistics%29\" target=\"_blank\">resampling<\/a>; I&rsquo;ll take the records from my filtered data file and create 10K portfolios for a variety of portfolio sizes, using random sampling with replacement. Then it&rsquo;s straightforward to determine how much the returns at each portfolio size can vary. Essentially, we&rsquo;re performing the following thought experiment: what if 10K angels randomly invested in the startups that Rob studied? What if they each invested in 10, 20, 30,&hellip; companies? How likely would a given angel have been to achieve a given return?<\/p>\n<p>The return for the entire sample is a 42% IRR and a 3.7x payout multiple. The graph below shows the probability of achieving at least 1x, 2x, and 3x the original investment for a range of portfolio sizes. [Excel file with data, sampling macro, and probability macro is <a href=\"http://possibleinsight.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/aipprscmstratresampling.xlsm\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.]<\/p>\n<p>Now you can see the diversification tradeoff. Personally, I think a bare minimum is a 90% chance of getting at least your money back. That&rsquo;s 15 investments. Roughly the same as Rob&rsquo;s answer of a &ldquo;dozen&rdquo;. But I&rsquo;d really prefer a 90% chance of doubling my money. That&rsquo;s 70 investments. Now, if I&rsquo;m managing other people&rsquo;s money, I&rsquo;d really like to push to an 80% chance of tripling their money, which is over 200 investments. I didn&rsquo;t run 400 investments, but I&rsquo;m guessing that is roughly the point at which you have a 90% chance of tripling other people&rsquo;s money. As far as I know, <a href=\"http://500.co/\" target=\"_blank\">500 Startups<\/a> is the only firm other than RSCM that is even shooting for that level of diversification in a single portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>So there&rsquo;s my take on the first issue, diversification as a tradeoff. The second issue is essentially the old problem of, &ldquo;Past performance is no guarantee of future results.&rdquo; What if the return distribution of seed stage technology startups is different going forward than during the period Rob collected data? It turns out there&rsquo;s a nifty way to use resampling to test the sensitivity of different levels of diversification to shifts in the return curve. That&rsquo;s the topic of the next post.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p>I&rsquo;m a believer in continuous learning. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons I believe college is overrated (a finite education period doesn&rsquo;t seem all that useful in a world where you can fall behind in a blink of the eye). In addition to continuous learning, I believe in experiential learning (learning by doing). Simple example, if you want to learn how to play basketball go play some basketball. You&rsquo;ll learn a little by reading a book about basketball, but you&rsquo;ll learn a lot more by actually doing it. The same goes for programming, construction work, running a business, or pretty much anything.<\/p>\n<p>About a month ago I was in TX for our family Christmas. I noticed something interesting among the group - most of the learning was being experienced by the older family members and the teaching was coming from the younger family members. I literally watched my 11 year old cousin teach my 50 year old uncle how to use his iPhone. My little brother was teaching my parents how to use the video camera. And another cousin was teaching my grandparents how to connect to the wifi on their new iPad. This was intriguing to me on many levels.<\/p>\n<p>I thought about how backwards (and cool) it would have seemed if my grandma was teaching her grandkids something new about technology. I developed a goal that when I&rsquo;m a grandparent to stay on top of technology to the point where I can at least teach my grandkids something new about the technology of their time. Maybe not know more than them, but at least know a few things they don&rsquo;t.<\/p>\n<p>In an effort to accomplish my goal I am trying to instill continuous and experiential learning into my every day life. I plan to learn a new piece of technology every week and post it on this blog. It can be something very simple, but must benefit me in some way.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few things I learned in 2012 that would qualify:<\/p>\n<p><strong

Waze - A better navigation app than maps on the iPhone. Also includes reporting of traffic jams, accidents, and police.<\/p>\n<p>2. Boomerang - Gmail plugin that lets you send email at a later time. Comes in handy when you are writing messages late at night and don&rsquo;t want the recipient to see your odd work schedule.<\/p>\n<p>3. Rapportive - Gmail plugin that shows you everyhing about your contacts. It pulls info from their LinkedIn, Facebook, and other online profiles.<\/p>\n<p>4. Flux - It makes the color of your monitor display adapt to the time of day, warm at night, cold during the day. It&rsquo;s supposed to help you sleep better.<\/p>\n<p>5. Audible - Not a new service by any means, but I just started using it in 2012. I don&rsquo;t like to read, but I don&rsquo;t mind listening. I read about 10 times as many books in 2012 as I did in 2011 thanks to audio books.<\/p>\n<p>6. Shutterfly - Turn your photos into books or cards. It&rsquo;s really easy to use and makes a great gift.<\/p>\n<p>7. Venmo - Pay your friends from your phone. It&rsquo;s simple. Takes about 5 minutes to setup and can change the way you think about money (literally)<\/p>\n<p>8. Posterous - Makes micro blogging a cinch. Came in handy for my picture a day project.<\/p>\n<p>9. Postagram - I&rsquo;m terrible at sending thank you cards or anything by snail mail. This app allows you to deliver a postcard from your phone and include a picture for $1.<\/p>\n<p>10. Trello - A collaborative todo list tool. I mostly use it on my laptop, but there is also a mobile app. Great for sharing todo lists and managing small projects.<\/p>"

It&rsquo;s not one that inspires confidence in those you&rsquo;re pitching to, but in my case, it&rsquo;s the only word that applies.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http://earthineer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Earthineer<\/a> is a network designed exclusively for homesteading and sustainable living that allows people to socialize, find experts, and trade.<\/p>\n<p>Many investors think of a &ldquo;homesteader&rdquo; as some guy with bad teeth and an unkempt beard&hellip;someone who is distilling moonshine back in the hills, and eeking a meager existance out of a mean soil.<\/p>\n<p>In actuality, the word &ldquo;homesteader&rdquo; is having a bit of a Rennaissance. It&rsquo;s even taking place in urban environments, and the title &ldquo;urban homesteader&rdquo; has been used to described homesteading activities in suburban/urban environments. Chickens are going into suburban backyards, yards are being transformed into edible landscapes, and beehives are going on the top of city buildings.<\/p>\n<p>My point is this – I recognize that I often have a hurdle to overcome when pitching Earthineer. I have to describe the topics, and I have to be appeal to the audience I&rsquo;m pitching to. If I&rsquo;m lucky, there will be people in the audience for whom the idea actually resonates.<\/p>\n<p>I participated in the <a href=\"http://cob.nku.edu/inkubator.html\" target=\"_blank\">INKUBATOR<\/a> program this last year. It offered all of the classes and mentors that you&rsquo;d expect out of an accelerator, and it was my first real introduction to the vibrant startup communities that are taking place in Cincinnati, Louisville, and Lexington.<\/p>\n<p>Through contacts that I made during the INKUBATOR, I met Warren Nash, and eventually found myself at the 5 Across competition on October 31st.<\/p>\n<p>By time that I pitched at <a href=\"http://www.5across.org/\" target=\"_blank\">5 Across<\/a>, I had already given this pitch twice before&hellip;but I was never more nervous than when I pitched that night. Sitting at the judges table was none other than Brad Feld. I had known that he was in town (I was going to attend one of his talks in Lexington), but I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated that he&rsquo;d be there at 5 Across as a judge.<\/p>\n<p>My pitch went well though, and as I passed by the judge&rsquo;s table to sit down, I could see that several of them were looking at Earthineer (some of them even signed up during the event – even Brad).<\/p>\n<p>It was humbling&hellip;and exciting.<\/p>\n<p>Afterwards, I had the opportunity to speak with one of the other judges. It turned out that he raised chickens and ducks. We talked for a long time&hellip;long after most of the crowd had left the Awesome Inc space.<\/p>\n<p>He wound up being an investor, and was my advocate when I went on to pitch to the Bluegrass Angels.<\/p>\n<p>I won $500 at the Oct. 31st pitch, and $1,000 at the finals.<\/p>\n<p>So&hellip;what did I use the prize money for? It&rsquo;s likely a boring use of those winnings, but I used them to pay my monthly operational costs – Rackspace, Embedly, SendGrid, etc.<\/p>\n<p>I admit to liking competitions&hellip;and the prize money was much-needed&hellip;but the value of prize money paled in comparison with the networking opportunities that I received as a result of pitching at 5 Across.<\/p>\n<p>Above all else, pitching is about finding advocates.<\/p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s the true value of the 5 Across competition and everything that Awesome Inc provides to Lexington - the opportunity to engage and participate in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.<\/p>"

I recently received an email from a previous intern (team alpha member) posing the question. I&rsquo;ve copied the contents of my email response below. At some point, I&rsquo;ll likely turn this into a more organized blog post.<\/p>\n<p>Hi &lt;name ommitted&gt;,  <\/p>\n<p>Thanks for reaching out. Here&rsquo;s some feedback on networking:<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s definitely important to know the right people. It will benefit you a lot. But it&rsquo;s actually more important that people know you. We have a saying at Awesome Inc - &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what you know - it&rsquo;s who you know, who knows you, and what they think of you.&rdquo; With that in mind, here are some tips:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Relationships take time. We know a lot of people in Lexington now and they know us as well. But that wasn&rsquo;t the case 5 years ago. It took a lot of time.<\/li>\n<li>Give before you get. <a href=\"http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2013/01/give-before-you-get.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read what Brad Feld thinks of this here<\/a>. Go into every conversation with one question in mind, What can I do for this person? Delivering on that will make them want to know you and they will think highly of you.<\/li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of failing at networking - you&rsquo;ll walk away from a lot of conversations thinking you just made a fool of yourself or looked like an idiot to the person you just met. It might even be true that you sounded dumb or said something that didn&rsquo;t make sense. That&rsquo;s ok though. Just like anything else, the more you practice it the better you get.<\/li>\n<li>Use pivots / intros - If you can get someone at an event to intro you to someone you want to know, that is ideal. A lot of times this trick works - If you identify someone you want to meet, watch them interact with someone else at the event. Then simply go to the person they were just talking to and introduce yourself and say, &ldquo;I noticed you were talking to &lt;networking target&gt;, I&rsquo;d like to meet them. Could you introduce me.&rdquo; They will almost always say yes.<\/li>\n<li>Have something of value to say / add - Be prepared to say something relevant and value add to the person you are approaching. Sometimes you can even do research ahead of time on the person you are approaching and understand their interests or needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Hope this helps.<\/p>"

Somehow Boulder has attained the mythical entrepreneurial status we also attribute to Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area and Research Triangle.<\/p>\n<p>Now back in the post-Nam days, when I was a longer-haired undergrad at CU-Boulder, the only local entrepreneurs I can recall utilized baggies to distribute their product. Gnarly for sure, but definitely not a global hot spot.<\/p>\n<p>So, I wondered, what changed since the late &lsquo;70s, besides the merciful death of disco? How had the most liberal college town in America transformed itself into one of the preeminent entrepreneurial communities in the world and a birthplace of TechStars?<\/p>\n<p>Maybe Feld&rsquo;s speech would provide some answers, so I bought a ticket (and later, his book).<\/p>\n<p><strong>From Boulder to Louisville<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In Feld&rsquo;s TED-style talk, he used a flip chart to quickly lay out what he calls the &ldquo;Boulder Thesis&rdquo; (which he stretches to 200 pages in his book, <a href=\"http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001cZWWE7aEMZIql4s60WDDVqBhJHiQOv0Geeu_O6vuFYA9Utn_2rFGPAR28oFu-ZaARKnPUcdJ6EXD_qXo64kXREgE0lFY8Xw0HtgAFkz8DMcaynYOYWCUdQAZXYkARSZ-tX8Z5TmtL2MDoEqzsu6T3lFRSBMRk6lG4Hx_ZKCeC5xoA1N8aZ-JiHOx8Rs_b9QiwIT24On1X-c=\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Communities<\/a>). In short, Feld&rsquo;s Boulder Thesis states that a vibrant entrepreneurial community must:<\/p>\n<ol><li>Be led by entrepreneurs who<\/li>\n<li>Have a long-term commitment, and<\/li>\n<li>Be inclusive of anyone who wants to participate in it, and<\/li>\n<li>Continually engage the entire entrepreneurial stack.<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>Understand that Boulder, which is fondly referred to as &ldquo;eight square miles surrounded by reality,&rdquo; sports five major research labs and the most degreed population in the United States. So it&rsquo;s a pseudo-Oz, and whatever they do or (now legally) smoke out there might not translate to Kentucky.<\/p>\n<p>But what if it does? What if our most ambitious people self-organized into the best job and wealth creation machine this side of the Rockies?<img alt=\"\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://ih.constantcontact.com/fs196/1109242059048/img/126.jpg\"/><\/p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m here to proclaim that the soul of the Boulder Thesis is, indeed, beginning to trend right here in the Bluegrass. Granted, we don&rsquo;t yet match their 2013 Rockin&rsquo; Mountain High community, but (cue Journey) we are at least in the '80s, or maybe even (fade to Pearl Jam) the '90s in Boulder time, edging ever closer to the so-2009 Black Eyed Peas' <em>&ldquo;I Got A Feeling.&rdquo; (Way to remix those metaphors.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>My point is that this region is slowly but surely crafting its own energetic entrepreneurial community under flag bearers such as Phoebe Wood, Doug Cobb, Bob Saunders, Kimberly Nasief-Westergren, David Jones, Charlie Moyer, Tendai Charasika, Mark Crane, Greg Fischer, Adam Fish, Alex Frommeyer, Kris Kimel, Brian Raney, Suzanne Bergmeister and many others.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t a planned and managed affair; it&rsquo;s organic and authentic. It&rsquo;s like cat herding. It&rsquo;s highly inclusive and spans the &ldquo;stack&rdquo; from investors to entrepreneurs to supporters. It includes long-standing groups such as Venture Connectors, KSTC, Nucleus and Enterprise Corp.; alongside rogues like Forge and Startup Weekend.<\/p>\n<p>With the Gil Holland-led re-entrepreneurization of NuLu, the community even has a homeland.<\/p>\n<p><strong>From Louisville to the Commonwealth<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To paraphrase Brad Feld, we are witnessing the birth of not just the Louisville Thesis, but the Kentucky Thesis, which I might point out is miraculously overcoming basketball rivalries and connecting with like-minded clusters of entrepreneurial diasporas from Paducah to Lexington to Covington.<\/p>\n<p>A good thing? I damn well think so, and cheer on all comers who are willing to pitch in, whether by starting a company, investing, working, sponsoring or just showing up. We don&rsquo;t have to become Boulder. <em>Who needs weed dispensaries and 300 days of sunshine anyway?<\/em> We just need to be ourselves and stick with it.<\/p>\n<p>We have strengths in logistics, healthcare, food and manufacturing combined with that bull-headed Kentucky long-rifle sense of independence - hey, not every region is so blessed. We have plenty of bright people and ideas. And nobody sees us coming.<\/p>\n<p>Granted, it was probably a hair easier to grow a vibrant entrepreneurial community in progressive, highly educated, uber-cool Boulder. But when we do it here, Mr. Feld will have an even better book to write.<\/p>\n<p>Or maybe we&rsquo;ll just write it ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>For more of Kent&rsquo;s entrepreneurial insights, <a href=\"mailto:Mary.Thorsby@opmfinancial.com\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe<\/a> to OPM&rsquo;s incredibly popular monthly newsletter.

When you reach your destination, the last thing you want is a problem with your hotel room. Whether it is a lack of towels or some other issue, dealing with the front desk should be easier than it is.<\/p>\n<p>Enter Crambu, the personal concierge solution created by David Booth and Tommy Crush. David, an economics and finance major, and Tommy, a business and computer science major, both juniors at the University of Kentucky, saw the need for innovation in the hotel industry. Crambu went through multiple iterations, beginning as a simple text based solution for guest feedback, evolving into a full graphic interface for guest interaction. Working with George Ward, a local Bluegrass Angel, David and Tommy have developed a tool that has the potential to redefine the standard for guest satisfaction in the hotel industry.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of having to call the front desk, guests using Crambu are able to handle most requests through their mobile phone or tablet device. Since there is no app to download, Crambu works with both smart phones and non-smart phones. The Crambu interface gives guests the power to send requests for items such as towels or other essential items, like soap. Forget your toothbrush? Use Crambu to let the front desk know. The front desk will send a confirmation to your request, leaving no uncertainty as to whether or not your request was received.<\/p>\n<p>Crambu is not just for finding solutions to common hotel room problems. Pertinent information, such as how to access wifi, location of vending machines, pool and restaurant hours, television channel guide, etc. are all at your fingertips. Crambu also provides information for the local area, suggesting potential dinner attractions and entertainment options, along with local emergency information.<\/p>\n<p>The best part about Crambu is the price. It is free for all guests. David and Tommy have a promising addition to the hotel experience. A true personal concierge for guests who are looking to streamline and simplify their travel experience.<\/p>"

At the competition, the four teams had the opportunity to pitch their ideas to members of the Lexington Venture Club to receive feedback and for a chance to win $500. Before the competition got underway, Zach Pennington and Josh Strange, the founders of <a href=\"https://giftpool.co/\" target=\"_blank\">GiftPool<\/a>, who won the most recent <a href=\"http://www.5across.org/\" target=\"_blank\">5 Across<\/a>, were given a chance to pitch to the venture club members for feedback. 5 Across is also sponsored by the Lexington Venture Club.<\/p>\n<p>The four competing teams were:<\/p>\n<p>• EARly Tag: A group that plans to implement ear tag technology to monitor the movement and health of livestock.<\/p>\n<p>• Precision Medical: A group that is introducing a new suction bulb device for patients after having certain surgeries.<\/p>\n<p>• Integral Solutions: A group planning to utilize integral lens array technology to cut down on the growing problem of counterfeit drug production.<\/p>\n<p>• TerraCast Technologies: A group planning to use switchgrass to help with land reclamation and butanol bio-fuel production.<\/p>\n<p>TerraCast Technologies won the pitch competition. Their plan consists of land reclamation using switchgrass, harvesting it and using the biomass to produce an acetone, butanol, ethanol mixture for bio-fuel. This will potentially create a new cash crop for Kentucky, and the adoption of butanol as a bio-fuel is expected increase rapidly. TerraCast is made up of MBA students Jordan Denny, Lee Goatley, Jarrod Willis, and Jordan Laycock. The technology they plan to implement is based on the work of UK professors Sue Nokes and Michael Montross, who won a seven million dollar grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for their work with switchgrass.<\/p>"

      "regular-body": "<p><strong>Tyler Green: A renaissance man in the making<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One can&rsquo;t sum up Tyler Green in just a few sentences. This UK Computer Engineering senior and Students Today, Alumni Tomorrow (STAT)/TEAM WILDCAT member has a diverse set of interests that, at first, seem like a bit of a conundrum.<\/p>\n<p>He enjoys photography, reading, and ballroom dancing, to name a few. He also loves to travel and in 2012 made it his goal to travel out of state once a month. Incorporating his love of travel, stadiums, and technology, he created a website that chronicles his journeys to sports stadiums. How&rsquo;s that for well-rounded?<\/p>\n<p>First things first, Green is an active, devoted member of the UK Alumni Association&rsquo;s STAT/TEAM WILDCAT groups.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;For me, TEAM WILDCAT was a no-brainer (to join), as they emphasized athletic spirit and travel to support UK,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The bus trips are far and away the best activities I&rsquo;ve gotten to experience. Sports and stadium travel are one of my primary interests that I pursue on my own with family and friends, so having the opportunity to complete that same goal with large groups of peers has been perfect. I have joined TEAM WILDCAT on overnight trips to football games at Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Missouri, as well as day trips for men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s basketball and women&rsquo;s soccer in Louisville.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Green feels that even though he is not yet a graduate, the association has played a valuable role in his time as a UK student and provided him many opportunities to connect with UK&rsquo;s vast alumni community.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Having a connection with the UK Alumni Association will benefit students for the rest of their lives by providing a community of individuals with similar backgrounds, regardless of where you end up living,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This could be having a leg up on a job opportunity because of a UK connection with an employer or simply having fellow UK fans with whom to watch a game. I actually have a perfect example of this: I was visiting Indianapolis in 2011 on the day of a UK basketball game. During the drive up, I looked up the location of the local UK Alumni Association game watch party and was able to navigate to that establishment. As a result, I was able to watch the game with fellow UK fans and talk about the team, UK, and Lexington, as if I had never left home.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of leaving home, Green has traveled to 43 stadium venues across the country. His casual interest of stadiums developed into something more during an internship his freshman year.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;I was interning at Awesome Inc., a Lexington company that promotes entrepreneurship, and had some free time to learn some new programming languages using online resources,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Being immersed in this entrepreneurial environment caused me to channel my interests into a creative endeavor, so I created a shell website using databases that allowed individual user accounts. However, I still needed a topic on which to focus my development, so I picked my casual interest of stadiums. I had always enjoyed visiting a new stadium when I had the opportunity, but I never went out of my way to do so. After making it the subject of the site, it became a primary interest, one which actually became the sole reason for taking many trips. I had always traveled and watched sports with my family, but having a personal hobby such as visiting stadiums, as well as having an engineering focus with the website behind it, really caused my interest to take off. My Stadium Fanatic profile currently lists 43 stadiums I have visited, and about two-thirds of these have come since the July 2010 launch of the website. There are a couple hundred users on the website, and it continues to be an excellent showcase and talking point during job interviews. I am proud of how it represented a fusion of my technical and extracurricular interests. It also motivates me to complete goals of visiting all 30 Major League Baseball parks (I am currently at 11) and 14 SEC Football Stadiums (I am currently at six.)&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>You can check out Green&rsquo;s website at <a href=\"http://www.stadiumfanatic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.stadiumfanatic.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>After graduating from UK in May, Green plans to attend graduate school for a master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Engineering. He hopes to find a school that combines great academics and athletics with an urban environment.<\/p>\n<p>With students like Green, it is easy to see why we have such great alumni! We look forward to welcoming this &ldquo;renaissance man in the making&rdquo; to the alumni family in just a few months. Who knows what he&rsquo;ll be up to once he graduates!<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Tyler Green\" src=\"http://ukalum.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tyler-green.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225\"/><\/p>"

This competition promotes entrepreneurship and innovation by rewarding the best idea with a cash prize. Prizes are awarded to groups/individuals who present the best new business concepts and plans. His winning idea is a business he started recently called<a href=\"http://www.controlmyadhd.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Control My ADHD<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some time ago, Grant Weherley noticed a rather large problem. He was trying to find resources to help individuals cope with their ADHD, but he found that all that was available were mere snippets of information sprinkled across countless websites. This information was hard to get to; sometimes in blog posts, sometimes in excerpts from books or magazines, or in lengthy webinars. All sources for the information relied on these clunky, unappealing formats which are rather ineffective and unpleasant for someone with ADHD. Grant set out to create a resource for those who wanted this extremely helpful information about dealing with ADHD symptoms in a format that would be, &ldquo;quick, painless, and informative, and maybe even a bit fun.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>To that end, Grant created the website, Control My ADHD. The website offers many tools, tailored specifically for assisting adults who suffer from ADHD. When asked if he would consider expanding the site to cover children and adolescents as well, he was said it was a possibility for the future. According to Grant, Control My ADHD provides users with &ldquo;the best strategies for utilizing their strengths to overcome their ADHD symptoms in interactive, visually engaging formats.&rdquo; The blog area of the website is open to everyone, and is being updated with free information on a regular basis. The video area is for members only. A newly discounted $25 subscription fee gives users access to a full ADHD mastery video course, which guides users through a series of lessons with new content on a weekly basis. A free sample video is available on the website, along with other useful information.

      "regular-title": "Why We're Not Running An Accelerator This Year",
      "regular-body": "<p>Last year, we made a decision that we would significantly increase the scale of <a href=\"http://accelerator.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc’s accelerator program<\/a> - or we would run no accelerator at all. This choice was made in order to operate in accordance with our own core values, particularly CV#2: Be Excellent. The criteria we set for ourselves were as follows:<\/p>\n<ul><li>Attract over 100 startup teams (CHECK - 135 applicants)<\/li>\n<li>Build a top-quality mentor network with over 60 mentors (CHECK - most are listed <a href=\"http://accelerator.awesomeinc.org/mentors.html\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Raise $150k to cover the cost of 6 teams (FAIL)<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>There are many possible causes for our failure to raise the required funding to run this year’s Awesome Inc accelerator program. We will explore those later, but for now we&rsquo;d like to let you in on what we are doing in place of the accelerator program, how it will positively affect the startup community, and how you can help.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"\">The new plan<\/h2>\n<p>There are three initiatives that we&rsquo;re undertaking to continue our mission to create and grow high tech startups in the region:<\/p>\n<ol><li>Early Stage Investment: <a href=\"http://cherubfund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Cherub Fund<\/a> - There is plenty of money available in this region to support startups. However, we noticed a disconnect between the sources of money and the startups seeking the money. Fortunately, this corresponded to a missing piece for young entrepreneurs who wanted to make investments in other local startups, but aren&rsquo;t yet qualified to write big checks. Initially dubbed the &ldquo;tiny angel fund&rdquo;, the Cherub Fund will make a series of small investments at a consistent rate in promising startup teams. At this super early stage, the selection criteria are very strongly weighted toward founder-market fit as a precursor to product-market fit. The Cherub Fund will promiscuously invest small amounts of money (ranging from $2k - $8k) in an effort to spur entrepreneurial and startup investment activity.<\/li>\n<li>Provide Resources and Raise Awareness: The Awesome Inc Fellowship Program - Working with<a href=\"http://thinkbluegrass.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bluegrass Business Development Partnership<\/a> and the <a href=\"http://www.thinkkentucky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development<\/a>, Awesome Inc will continue to offer resources to startups such as space, mentorship, networking events, access to technical talent, and more. Many of the resources we intended to offer with the accelerator program will be available to these startups.<\/li>\n<li>Education: <a href=\"http://awesomeincu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc U<\/a> - Aspiring entrepreneurs often come to us asking where they can find a technical co-founder. This typically means someone who can build a mobile app or web application software. Realizing that there is a shortage of supply of people with those skills, we&rsquo;ve decided to launch a coding school. The courses we offer are hands-on and are designed to help students quickly acquire relevant technical skills. The result of Awesome Inc U will be more technical talent in the region to better match the needs of the high tech startups.<\/li>\n<\/ol><h2 id=\"\">How can you help<\/h2>\n<p>Acknowledging the naturally low rate of success for startups, there are currently far too few startups getting started. We need more people (this means you!) to choose the entrepreneurial path and start a company. Dive in by participating in a <a href=\"http://startupweekend.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Weekend<\/a> or pitching at <a href=\"http://www.5across.org/\" target=\"_blank\">5 Across<\/a>. If you have an idea but need some new technical skills in order to execute on it, sign up for a course at <a href=\"http://awesomeincu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc U<\/a>. If you have already been successful as an entrepreneur, it’s time to share the expertise and network you have built by mentoring a startup. <a href=\"mailto:founders@awesomeinc.org?subject=Become%20a%20mentor\" target=\"_blank\">Contact us<\/a>, and we’ll add you to our mentor database. If you’ve been really successful, consider<a href=\"https://angel.co/kentucky\" target=\"_blank\">investing some capital in local startups<\/a>, especially those with a solid team and meaningful customer traction. If you know of a startup that might be a good fit for the Cherub Fund or Awesome Inc Fellowship program, please <a href=\"mailto:founders@awesomeinc.org?subject=Recommend%20a%20startup%20for%20Cherub%20Fund%20or%20Fellowship\" target=\"_blank\">send them our way<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks again for participating in this journey with us.

      "regular-title": "5 Reasons Why Everyone Should Learn To Code",
      "regular-body": "<p>Since we started <a href=\"http://awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc<\/a> four years ago, three words have adorned the front glass of our office: technology, creativity, startups. These three words have a very intentional interplay: Technology is the ability to turn your ideas into reality, Creativity is the ability to notice hidden opportunities and form ideas, and Startups are the most efficient vehicle for combining Technology and Creativity to get something useful in the hands of the people who want it. We’ve spent quite a bit of time focused on the third frame with our <a href=\"http://accelerator.awesomeinc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">startup accelerator program<\/a>, hosting <a href=\"http://startupweekend.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Startup Weekends<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.5across.org/\" target=\"_blank\">5 Across<\/a> pitch contests, and the creation of the<a href=\"http://cherubfund.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Cherub Fund<\/a>. Yet we recently began to notice that we overlooked the first prerequisite. As we met more startup founders, we found that while they had great ideas and unique perspectives, and they were willing to make the necessary sacrifices to start a company, they were often lacking in the technical ability to build what they had envisioned. As we talked with entrepreneurs from around the country, as well as the leaders of mature-stage technology companies, we found that this dearth of technical ability is not an isolated problem. In the city of Louisville alone, there are <a href=\"http://www.codelouisville.org/\" target=\"_blank\">over 400 programmer job openings<\/a>, and the lack of appropriately-trained technical talent is even more intense in major tech hubs like Silicon Valley.<\/p>\n<p>When we launched <a href=\"http://awesomeincu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc U<\/a> earlier this summer, we were not the first to realize that our world needs to put the tools of software development in the hands of a lot more people. There are already a handful of great learn-to-code resources available that run the gamut from game creation for kids (<a href=\"http://scratch.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Scratch<\/a>) to free online courses in web development (<a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Codecademy<\/a>) to intense semester-long bootcamps (<a href=\"http://devbootcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dev Bootcamp<\/a>). While all of these pieces are necessary, we’ve chosen to start with one of the biggest barriers to coding: getting started. Recent studies on habit formation show that it’s much harder to get started with a new habit than it is progress deeper toward expertise. Doing your first 5 pushups is probably more difficult than the next 500. This so-called “activation energy” (familiar topic for any chemists in the room) is what we intend to help our students overcome. As writing code evolves from a niche activity for the few to a broadly-practiced art, the tools and techniques will gradually be modified for a mass audience. Until then, writing code will remain an intimidating thing to newcomers. Intimidating, but far from impossible. In fact, as we have learned from the diverse group of nearly 100 newly-minted coders who have taken our courses this summer, anyone CAN learn to code. Just like riding a bicycle, playing an instrument, or cooking a meal, software development is a skill that just takes a little guidance and a lot of practice. So, why SHOULD everyone learn to code? Here are a few ideas to get you started:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Get A Job<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Seriously, the <a href=\"http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer\" target=\"_blank\">best job you can get right now<\/a> has to be as a software developer. Maybe you won’t have all the over-the-top perks of working somewhere like Google, but you’ll still get paid almost double what your liberal arts peers are making, you’ll often have the flexibility to telecommute, you get to spend your days working with creative people to solve challenging problems, and your non-coding boss just might think you are a magician. With demand for programmers expected to grow, your options are only getting better.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Be Your Own Boss<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maybe creating video games, social networking apps, or launch software for space missions doesn’t sound meaningful enough for you. If you’re really passionate about pets, then why don’t you go start <a href=\"http://tagapet.org/\" target=\"_blank\">a service that helps return lost pets to their owners<\/a>? Both dogs and their owners will rejoice, all while you work from the comfort of your basement in the company of Fido. When people work on the things they’re most passionate about, the world becomes a better place. If you can’t find a great job that’s already out there, now is a better time than ever to create your own job.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Create Beautiful New Things<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Can you imagine if Picasso never learned how to use a paintbrush? What if Mozart never learned how to play the piano? Software is a powerful tool for creating visual art, music, movies, and interactive experiences. When was the last time you expressed yourself through Python? Ever used Ruby to create a masterpiece? (Protip: check out <a href=\"http://processing.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Processing<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.image-line.com/documents/flstudio.html\" target=\"_blank\">FL Studio<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.openframeworks.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenFrameworks<\/a>, a few of the most popular software kits for artists).<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Learn To Think In A New Way<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The most important thing I learned from playing sports as a kid was not how to hit a baseball or catch a football, but how to work with a team. For many people, learning to code is the same. Plenty of people with computer science and engineering training don’t actually do the work prescribed by their degree, but they constantly use the problem-solving abilities that they honed throughout their studies. The Greeks were huge fans of using logic to win arguments, and if you can argue successfully with something as unwavering as a compiler, human beings will be a pushover. The ability to create within a system of constraints like software is a powerful skill that goes far beyond app development, but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCDkxUbalCw\" target=\"_blank\">you don’t have to take my word for it<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. Change The World<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It’s hard to argue with the impact that software has had on our world over the past decade. From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring\" target=\"_blank\">political revolutions<\/a> to <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html\" target=\"_blank\">industrial revolutions<\/a>, the enabling power of this new layer of software has changed the way we live. But this impact has not yet been felt everywhere. As our population shifts toward primarily city dwelling, our transportation systems and other utilities will rely on software to make more intelligent adjustments. The educational systems that we developed a century ago for a different era of industrial work must grow to adapt to the children of today and the jobs of tomorrow. What if your algorithms could help with the <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-release/knight-news-challenge-health-data-contest-opens/\" target=\"_blank\">analysis of public health data<\/a> that leads to a cure for cancer? Could your wellness app help someone to make better lifestyle choices and avoid the risk of obesity and diabetes?<\/p>\n<p>From startups to the star tech companies of the Fortune 500, from government and nonprofits to sports and entertainment, software development is a powerful skill. It can land you a job, help you start your own company, enable you to create new forms of art, change the way you think about the world, and change the way the world thinks about itself. <a href=\"http://awesomeincu.com/\" target=\"_blank\">If you want to learn to code, we’re ready to help you get started.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>by Nick Such<\/p>"
